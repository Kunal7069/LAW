CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL Nos. 1492­1493 OF 2010
GURJIT SINGH ....APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
STATE OF PUNJAB .... RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
B.R. GAVAI, J.
1. These appeals by special leave challenge the judgment
and order dated 20.2.2009 passed by the Division Bench of the
Punjab and Haryana High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 544­
DBA of 2001 and Criminal Appeal No. 959­SB of 2000. All the
four accused, including the appellant herein (accused No.3),
who is husband of the deceased, were charged and tried by the
learned trial Court for the offence punishable under Section
304­B and Section 498­A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(hereinafter referred to as “IPC”). The other accused were the
father (accused No.1), the mother (accused No.2) and the sister­
in­law (wife of brother) (accused No.4) of the appellant. The2
Additional Sessions Judge, Hoshiarpur, held that the
prosecution had succeeded in proving the case against accused
Nos. 1 to 3 for the offence punishable under Section 498­A of
the IPC but has failed to prove the case against the said accused
(Nos. 1, 2 and 3) for the offence punishable under Section 304­
B of the IPC. Insofar as accused No. 4 is concerned, it was held
that the prosecution has failed to prove the case against her for
both the offences and she was accordingly acquitted of the
offence charged. The trial Judge, therefore, convicted the
appellant and his father and mother for the offence punishable
under Section 498­A of the IPC and sentenced them to undergo
rigorous imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a
fine of Rs. 4000/­ each and, in default of payment of fine, to
further undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three
months.
2. Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence under
Section 498­A of the IPC, the appellant along with his parents
preferred an appeal (being Criminal Appeal No.959­SB of 2000)
before the High Court. So also, the State preferred an appeal
(being Criminal Appeal No.544­DBA of 2001), being aggrieved by
that part of the order by which the trial Court acquitted accused
No. 4 and also acquitted accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for the offence3
punishable under Section 304­B of the IPC. The High Court
upheld the conviction of accused Nos. 1, 2 and 3 for the offence
punishable under Section 498­A of the IPC. It also upheld the
acquittal of accused No. 4 and further held that, though the
prosecution could not bring the case under Section 304­B of the
IPC, the appellant herein was liable to be punished for the
offence punishable under Section 306 of the IPC. The High
court maintained the order of the sentence and fine as recorded
by the trial Judge for the offence punishable under Section 498­
A of the IPC. For the offence under Section 306 of the IPC, the
High Court sentenced the appellant herein to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.
5000/­ and in default of payment of fine, to further undergo
rigorous imprisonment for a period of five months. Being
aggrieved thereby, the present appeals are preferred by the
appellant.
3. Shri Rajeshwar Singh Thakur, learned counsel for the
appellant, submitted that the conviction as recorded by the
learned trial court and confirmed by the High Court under
Section 498­A of the IPC is not tenable. It is submitted, that the
conviction is only on the basis of the evidence of PW­10 ­ Bishan
Singh, the father of the deceased. It is submitted, that there is4
no corroboration to the said evidence. It is submitted, that in
any case, the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC is not
tenable. It is contended that the charge was for the offence
punishable under Section 304­B of the IPC, the ingredients of
which are totally different than the ingredients of Section 306 of
the IPC. It is submitted that as such grave prejudice was caused
to the appellant. It is further submitted that the evidence shows
that the father of the deceased, PW­10, has stated, that even
during the course of the trial, the appellant was on congenial
meeting terms with the father of the deceased and as such the
unnatural human conduct would discredit his testimony.
4. Per contra, Smt. Jaspreet Gogia, learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the State, submitted that insofar as
conviction under Section 498­A of the IPC is concerned, since
there is a concurrent finding, no interference is warranted. She
further submitted, that since the ingredients of Section 304­B
and Section 306 of the IPC are almost similar, no prejudice was
caused to the appellant by convicting him under Section 306 of
the IPC though no charge was framed for the same. It is
submitted that all the ingredients necessary for conviction
under Section 306 with the aid of Section 113­A of the Indian5
Evidence Act, 1872 were duly proved by the prosecution and as
such no interference is warranted in the present appeals.
5. The perusal of the record would reveal that though the
appellant has disputed the date of marriage to be 04.02.1989,
both the courts have disbelieved him and rightly so. The
deceased died an unnatural death on 28.09.1994 by consuming
poison. As such, the unnatural death occurred within a period
of seven years of the marriage. The learned trial Judge has
acquitted the appellant for the offence punishable under Section
304­B of the IPC since the prosecution has failed to prove the
demand for dowry, while convicting him along with the parents
for the offence punishable under Section 498­A of the IPC. The
High Court maintained the conviction under Section 498­A of
the IPC, however, it also convicted the appellant for the offence
punishable under Section 306 of the IPC with the aid of Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
6. The question that we are called upon to answer is as to
whether the conviction as confirmed by the High Court under
Section 498­A of the IPC and as recorded by it for the first time
under Section 306 of the IPC would be sustainable or not.6
7. The relevant provisions of the IPC that fall for
consideration are as under:
“107. Abetment of a thing ­ A person abets the doing of
a thing, who—
First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or
Secondly.—Engages with one or more other person or
persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if
an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that
conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or
Thirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal
omission, the doing of that thing.
Explanation 1.—A person who, by wilful
misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material
fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or
procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be
done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
Explanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of
the commission of an act, does anything in order to
facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby
facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing
of that act.
xxx
306. Abetment of suicide.—If any person commits
suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide,
shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to ten years, and
shall also be liable to fine.
xxx
498­A. Husband or relative of husband of a woman
subjecting her to cruelty.— Whoever, being the
husband or the relative of the husband of a woman,
subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years
and shall also be liable to fine. Explanation.—For the
purposes of this section, “cruelty” means— (a) any wilful
conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to drive the
woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or
danger to life, limb or health (whether mental or physical)7
of the woman; or (b) harassment of the woman where
such harassment is with a view to coercing her or any
person related to her to meet any unlawful demand for
any property or valuable security or is on account of
failure by her or any person related to her to meet such
demand.”
8. The relevant provision of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
that also requires consideration is as follows:
“113­A. Presumption as to abetment of suicide
by a married woman. ­­When the question is
whether the commission of suicide by a woman had
been abetted by her husband or any relative of her
husband and it is shown that she had committed
suicide within a period of seven years from the date
of her marriage and that her husband or such
relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty,
the court may presume, having regard to all the
other circumstances of the case, that such suicide
had been abetted by her husband or by such relative
of her husband.
Explanation. ­­ For the purposes of this section,
"cruelty" shall have the same meaning as in section
498A of the IPC (45 of 1860).]”
9. The perusal of the evidence of PW­10 ­ Bishan Singh, the
father of the deceased, would establish that the deceased,
Jaswinder Kaur was married to appellant on 04.02.1989. His
daughter had two issues. The elder one was four years old and
the son was about 1 ½ years old at the time of the occurrence.
He stated, that after the marriage, accused were harassing his
daughter for giving less dowry. In the year 1992, he had given
one steel almirah to his daughter but the accused were not8
satisfied with the dowry article. In March 1993, he had
purchased one fridge through his son­in­law, Jagtar Singh, from
the Military Canteen for Rs. 6,600/­, which was given to the
accused persons. Even then the accused were not satisfied. The
accused were pressing his daughter, Jaswinder Kaur, to bring
Rs. 50,000/­ from her parents. He further stated, that the
accused were compelling his daughter out of anger to bring
Rs. 50,000/­, in cash, as they were to purchase a plot at
Hoshiarpur. He further stated that on two­three occasions, his
daughter came to his Village Kharal Kalan and he requested her
that Rs. 50,000/­ were not with him at that stage and after
selling the paddy crop he can pay that amount. He stated that,
thereafter, after consoling his daughter, he sent her to her
in­laws house. He further stated, that on 28.09.1994 when he
was in his house, he came to know that his daughter had died.
Suspecting that his daughter was given poison or she consumed
poison, he lodged a report with the police.
10. To some extent, the evidence of PW­10 is corroborated by
the evidence of PW­13 ­ Iqbal Singh. He has stated, that prior
to the occurrence, i.e., the death of the deceased there was a
dispute between the accused persons and the deceased,
Jaswinder Kaur, as Rs. 50,000/­ was being demanded by the9
accused persons from the parents of the deceased for
purchasing a plot. He further stated, that the parents of the
deceased could not pay Rs. 50,000/­ and promised to pay the
same after selling paddy crop. He further stated, that before
demand of Rs. 50,000/­, one refrigerator and one almirah was
given to the accused persons by the parents of the deceased on
their demand and this was over and above dowry given at the
time of the marriage.
11. Thus from the evidence of PW­10 which is corroborated
to an extent by PW­13, we have no hesitation to hold that the
prosecution has proved that the deceased was harassed with a
view to coercing her or any person related to her to meet any
unlawful demand for any property or valuable security or such a
harassment was on account of failure by her or any person
related to her to meet such a demand. We find, that on the
basis of aforesaid evidence, the prosecution has proved the
charge under Explanation (b) of Section 498­A of the IPC.
12. Now the question that would fall for consideration is as to
whether when the prosecution establishes cruelty under
Explanation (b) of Section 498­A of the IPC and also establishes
that the deceased committed suicide within seven years of the
marriage, could the accused be also held guilty for the offence10
punishable under Section 306 of the IPC with the aid of Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act.
13. The said question fell for consideration before the bench
of three learned Judges of this Court in the case of Ramesh
Kumar vs. State of Chhattisgarh1. This Court, after
reproducing the provisions of Section 306 of the IPC and Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 observed thus:
“12. This provision was introduced by the
Criminal Law (Second) Amendment Act, 1983 with
effect from 26­12­1983 to meet a social demand to
resolve difficulty of proof where helpless married
women were eliminated by being forced to commit
suicide by the husband or in­laws and
incriminating evidence was usually available
within the four corners of the matrimonial home
and hence was not available to anyone outside the
occupants of the house. However, still it cannot be
lost sight of that the presumption is intended to
operate against the accused in the field of criminal
law. Before the presumption may be raised, the
foundation thereof must exist. A bare reading of
Section 113­A shows that to attract applicability of
Section 113­A, it must be shown that (i) the
woman has committed suicide, (ii) such suicide
has been committed within a period of seven years
from the date of her marriage, (iii) the husband or
his relatives, who are charged had subjected her
to cruelty. On existence and availability of the
abovesaid circumstances, the court may
presume that such suicide had been abetted by
her husband or by such relatives of her husband.
Parliament has chosen to sound a note of caution.
Firstly, the presumption is not mandatory; it is
only permissive as the employment of expression
“may presume” suggests. Secondly, the existence
1 (2001) 9 SCC 61811
and availability of the abovesaid three
circumstances shall not, like a formula, enable the
presumption being drawn; before the presumption
may be drawn the court shall have to have regard
to “all the other circumstances of the case”. A
consideration of all the other circumstances of the
case may strengthen the presumption or may
dictate the conscience of the court to abstain from
drawing the presumption. The expression — “the
other circumstances of the case” used in Section
113­A suggests the need to reach a cause­and­
effect relationship between the cruelty and the
suicide for the purpose of raising a presumption.
Last but not the least, the presumption is not an
irrebuttable one. In spite of a presumption having
been raised the evidence adduced in defence or
the facts and circumstances otherwise available
on record may destroy the presumption. The
phrase “may presume” used in Section 113­A is
defined in Section 4 of the Evidence Act, which
says — “Whenever it is provided by this Act that
the court may presume a fact, it may either regard
such fact as proved, unless and until it is
disproved, or may call for proof of it.
13. The present case is not one which may fall
under clauses secondly and thirdly of Section 107
of the Penal Code, 1860. The case has to be
decided by reference to the first clause i.e. whether
the accused­appellant abetted the suicide by
instigating her to do so.”
(emphasis supplied)
14. It could thus be seen, that this Court has observed that
to attract the applicability of Section 113­A of the Indian
Evidence Act, the following conditions are required to be
satisfied:
(i) The woman has committed suicide,12
(ii) Such suicide has been committed within a period of
seven years from the date of her marriage,
(iii) The husband or his relatives, who are charged had
subjected her to cruelty.
15. This Court further observed that on the existence and
availability of the aforesaid circumstances, the court may
presume that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or
by such relatives of her husband. It has been held that the
presumption is not mandatory; but only permissive as the
words “may presume” suggests. It has further been held that
the existence and availability of the aforesaid three
circumstances shall not, like a formula, enable the presumption
being drawn. It has been held that before a presumption being
drawn, the court shall have regard to all other circumstances of
the case. It has been held, that the consideration of all the other
circumstances of the case may strengthen the presumption or
may dictate the conscience of the court to abstain from drawing
the presumption. It thus observed that the expression “the other
circumstances of the case” used in Section 113­A of the Indian
Evidence Act suggests the need to reach a cause­and­effect
relationship between the cruelty and the suicide for the purpose
of raising a presumption.13
16. It has been further held that when the case does not fall
under clauses secondly and thirdly of Section 107 of the IPC,
the case is to be decided with reference to the first clause, i.e.,
whether the accused­appellant abetted the suicide by
instigating her to do so. It will be further relevant to refer to
following observations in Ramesh Kumar (supra):
“20. Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke,
incite or encourage to do “an act”. To satisfy the
requirement of instigation though it is not necessary
that actual words must be used to that effect or what
constitutes instigation must necessarily and
specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a
reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must
be capable of being spelt out. The present one is not
a case where the accused had by his acts or
omission or by a continued course of conduct
created such circumstances that the deceased was
left with no other option except to commit suicide in
which case an instigation may have been inferred. A
word uttered in the fit of anger or emotion without
intending the consequences to actually follow cannot
be said to be instigation.
21. In State of W.B. v. Orilal Jaiswal, (1994) 1
SCC 73, this Court has cautioned that the court
should be extremely careful in assessing the facts
and circumstances of each case and the evidence
adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding
whether the cruelty meted out to the victim had in
fact induced her to end her life by committing
suicide. If it transpires to the court that a victim
committing suicide was hypersensitive to ordinary
petulance, discord and differences in domestic life
quite common to the society to which the victim
belonged and such petulance, discord and
differences were not expected to induce a similarly
circumstanced individual in a given society to
commit suicide, the conscience of the court should14
not be satisfied for basing a finding that the accused
charged of abetting the offence of suicide should be
found guilty.
22. Sections 498­A and 306 IPC are independent
and constitute different offences. Though, depending
on the facts and circumstances of an individual case,
subjecting a woman to cruelty may amount to an
offence under Section 498­A and may also, if a
course of conduct amounting to cruelty is
established leaving no other option for the woman
except to commit suicide, amount to abetment to
commit suicide. However, merely because an
accused has been held liable to be punished under
Section 498­A IPC it does not follow that on the same
evidence he must also and necessarily be held guilty
of having abetted the commission of suicide by the
woman concerned…..”
(emphasis supplied)
17. The Court observed that instigation is to goad, urge
forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do “an act”. Though
the court observed that to satisfy the requirement of instigation,
it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect
or what constitutes instigation must necessarily and specifically
be suggestive of the consequence. However, it has been
observed that a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence
must be capable of being spelt out. Relying on the judgment of
this court in the case of State of West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal2,
it is observed that the court should be extremely careful in
assessing the facts and circumstances of each case and the
2 (1994) 1 SCC 7315
evidence adduced in the trial for the purpose of finding whether
the cruelty meted out to the victim had in fact induced her to
end her life by committing suicide. It has further been held that
Section 498­A and Section 306 of the IPC are independent and
constitute different offences. It has been observed, that
depending on the facts and circumstances of an individual case,
subjecting a woman to cruelty may amount to an offence under
Section 498­A of the IPC. It has further been observed, that if a
course of conduct amounting to cruelty is established leaving no
other option for the woman except to commit suicide, it may
also amount to abetment to commit suicide. It is further
observed, that, however, merely because accused had been held
liable to be punished under Section 498­A of the IPC, it does not
follow that on the same evidence he must also and necessarily
be held guilty of having abetted the commission of suicide by
the woman concerned.
18. Another three­Judge bench of this Court in the case of K.
Prema S. Rao and Anr. vs. Yadla Srinivasa Rao and Ors.3
had an occasion to consider the question as to whether in the
circumstances of framing charge only under Section 304­B of
the IPC and not framing the one under Section 306 of the IPC,
could the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC read with
3 (2003) 1 SCC 21716
Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act be tenable? In the
said case, the Court found that the charge specifically
mentioned as under.
“That on or about the 22nd day of October, 1989, at your
house at Tunikipadu of Gampalagudem Mandal, Yedla
Krishna Kumari, wife of A­1 among you and daughter­in­
law of A­2 and A­3 among you, committed suicide by
consuming poison, and that you all subjected her to such
cruelty and harassment as did drive her to commit
suicide, with the object of extracting ac. 5.00 of land as
dowry to A­1 and thereby committed an offence
punishable under Section 304­B of the Indian Penal
Code, 1860 and within the cognizance of this court.
or alternatively
That, prior to the 22nd day of October, 1989, at your
house at Tunikipadu, you subjected Yedla Krishna
Kumari, wife of A­1 among you and daughter­in­law of A­
2 and A­3 among you, to such cruelty and harassment as
did drive the said Krishna Kumari to commit suicide, and
thereby committed an offence punishable under Section
498­A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and within the
cognizance of this court.”
19. The court, therefore, held that the ingredients to
constitute an offence under Section 306 of the IPC were already
found in the charge and as such no prejudice was caused to the
accused therein, though no separate charge was framed under
Section 306 of the IPC. Apart from that, the evidence on record
established that when the letters concealed by the husband
were discovered by the wife and handed over to the father and
she was driven out of the house, this cruel conduct of the
husband led the wife to commit suicide. It could thus be seen,
that in the facts of the said case, the Court found that the17
conviction under Section 306 of the IPC could be recorded. It
was found that, apart from the earlier acts of harassment for
parting with the land which she had received in marriage as
stridhana, there was an act of driving the deceased out of the
house which had direct nexus with the deceased committing
suicide.
20. The bench of two Judges of this Court had an occasion
to consider a similar issue in the case of Hans Raj vs. State of
Haryana4. It will be relevant to refer to following paragraphs:
“12. The question then arises as to whether in the
facts and circumstances of the case the appellant can be
convicted of the offence under Section 306 IPC with the
aid of the presumption under Section 113­A of the Indian
Evidence Act. Any person who abets the commission of
suicide is liable to be punished under Section 306 IPC.
Section 107 IPC lays down the ingredients of abetment
which includes instigating any person to do a thing or
engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for
the doing of a thing, if an act or illegal omission takes
place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the
doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal
omission to the doing of that thing. In the instant case
there is no direct evidence to establish that the appellant
either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide
or entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing
suicide. In the absence of direct evidence the prosecution
has relied upon Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act
under which the court may presume on proof of
circumstances enumerated therein, and having regard to
all the other circumstances of the case, that the suicide
had been abetted by the accused. The explanation to
Section 113­A further clarifies that cruelty shall have the
same meaning as in Section 498­A of the Indian Penal
Code…...
4 (2004) 12 SCC 25718
13. Unlike Section 113­B of the Indian Evidence Act,
a statutory presumption does not arise by operation of
law merely on proof of the circumstances enumerated in
Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act. Under Section
113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, the prosecution has
first to establish that the woman concerned committed
suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her
marriage and that her husband (in this case) had
subjected her to cruelty. Even if these facts are
established the court is not bound to presume that the
suicide had been abetted by her husband. Section 113­A
gives a discretion to the court to raise such a
presumption, having regard to all the other
circumstances of the case, which means that where the
allegation is of cruelty it must consider the nature of
cruelty to which the woman was subjected, having regard
to the meaning of the word “cruelty” in Section 498­A
IPC. The mere fact that a woman committed suicide
within seven years of her marriage and that she had been
subjected to cruelty by her husband, does not
automatically give rise to the presumption that the
suicide had been abetted by her husband. The court is
required to look into all the other circumstances of the
case. One of the circumstances which has to be
considered by the court is whether the alleged cruelty
was of such nature as was likely to drive the woman to
commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life,
limb or health of the woman……”
21. The court found that in the case there was no direct
evidence to establish that the appellant either aided or
instigated the deceased to commit suicide or entered into any
conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide. It has been held
that when the allegation is of cruelty, it must consider the
nature of cruelty to which the woman was subjected having
regard to the meaning of the word “cruelty” in Section 498­A of
IPC. It has been held that one of the circumstances which has19
to be taken into consideration by the court is whether the
alleged cruelty was of such a nature as was likely to drive the
woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to
life, limb or health of the woman.
22. This court in the case of Hans Raj (supra) has also
referred to the judgment of this court in the case of State of
West Bengal vs. Orilal Jaiswal (supra), wherein it is observed
that the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not
stand altered even after the introduction of Section 498­A of the
IPC and Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act.
23. It will be relevant to refer to the following observations
of this Court in the case of Pinakin Mahipatray Rawal vs.
State of Gujarat5 :
“26. Section 113­A only deals with a presumption
which the court may draw in a particular fact situation
which may arise when necessary ingredients in order to
attract that provision are established. Criminal law
amendment and the rule of procedure was necessitated
so as to meet the social challenge of saving the married
woman from being ill­treated or forcing to commit suicide
by the husband or his relatives, demanding dowry.
Legislative mandate of the section is that when a woman
commits suicide within seven years of her marriage and it
is shown that her husband or any relative of her husband
had subjected her to cruelty as per the terms defined in
Section 498­A IPC, the court may presume having regard
to all other circumstances of the case that such suicide
has been abetted by the husband or such person.
Though a presumption could be drawn, the burden of
proof of showing that such an offence has been
5 (2013) 10 SCC 4820
committed by the accused under Section 498­A IPC is on
the prosecution. On facts, we have already found that the
prosecution has not discharged the burden that A­1 had
instigated, conspired or intentionally aided so as to drive
the wife to commit suicide or that the alleged extramarital
affair was of such a degree which was likely to drive the
wife to commit suicide.
27. Section 306 refers to abetment of suicide. It says
that if any person commits suicide, whoever abets the
commission of such suicide, shall be punished with
imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years
and shall also be liable to fine. The action for committing
suicide is also on account of mental disturbance caused
by mental and physical cruelty. To constitute an offence
under Section 306, the prosecution has to establish that
a person has committed suicide and the suicide was
abetted by the accused. The prosecution has to establish
beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased committed
suicide and the accused abetted the commission of
suicide. But for the alleged extramarital relationship,
which if proved, could be illegal and immoral, nothing
has been brought out by the prosecution to show that the
accused had provoked, incited or induced the wife to
commit suicide.”
24. It has thus been observed that though presumption could
be drawn, the burden of proof of showing that such an offence
has been committed by the accused is on the prosecution. The
prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the
accused had instigated, conspired or intentionally aided so as to
drive the wife to commit suicide.
25. In Mangat Ram vs. State of Haryana6 this Court
observed thus:
“28. We have already indicated that the trial court
has found that no offence under Section 304­B IPC has
6 (2014) 12 SCC 59521
been made out against the accused, but it convicted the
accused under Section 306 IPC, even though no charge
had been framed on that section against the accused.
The scope and ambit of Section 306 IPC has not been
properly appreciated by the courts below. ………..
Abetment of suicide is confined to the case of persons
who aid or abet the commission of the suicide. In the
matter of an offence under Section 306 IPC, abetment
must attract the definition thereof in Section 107 IPC.
Abetment is constituted by instigating a person to
commit an offence or engaging in a conspiracy to commit,
aid or intentional aiding a person to commit it. It would
be evident from a plain reading of Section 306 read with
Section 107 IPC that, in order to make out the offence of
abetment or suicide, necessary proof required is that the
culprit is either instigating the victim to commit suicide
or has engaged himself in a conspiracy with others for
the commission of suicide, or has intentionally aided by
an act or illegal omission in the commission of suicide.”
26. After observing the aforesaid, this Court, relying on the
judgment of this Court in the case of Hans Raj (supra),
observed that even if it is established that the woman concerned
had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the
date of marriage and that her husband has subjected her to
cruelty, the court is not bound to presume that suicide has
been abetted by her husband. It is required to take into
consideration all other circumstances of the case.
27. It could thus be seen, that the view taken by the
three­Judge Bench of this Court in the case of Ramesh Kumar
(supra) that when a case does not fall under clause secondly or
thirdly, it has to be decided with reference to the first clause,22
i.e., whether the accused has abetted the commission of suicide
by intentionally instigating her to do so; has been consistently
followed. As such, we are of the view that merely because an
accused is found guilty of an offence punishable under Section
498­A of the IPC and the death has occurred within a period of
seven years of the marriage, the accused cannot be
automatically held guilty for the offence punishable under
Section 306 of the IPC by employing the presumption under
Section 113­A of the Evidence Act. Unless the prosecution
establishes that some act or illegal omission by the accused has
driven the deceased to commit the suicide, the conviction under
Section 306 would not be tenable.
28. Insofar as the judgment of this Court in K. Prema S.
Rao (supra), on which the High Court had relied, is concerned,
we have already discussed hereinabove that in the said case
there was evidence on record proving that immediately prior to
committing the suicide the deceased was driven out of the
house. As such, it was held that the said cruelty would amount
to abetment to commit suicide.
29. Insofar as the judgment of this Court in Modinsab
Kasimsab Kanchagar vs. State of Karnataka & Anr.7 is
concerned, no doubt that the learned counsel for the State is
7 (2013) 4 SCC 55123
justified in relying on the said judgment as the conviction in the
said case is for the offence punishable under Section 498­A of
the IPC and Sections 3, 4 & 6 of the Dowry Prohibition Act,
1961. However, in the said case, the conviction under Section
304­B of the IPC was set aside by this Court. However, the
question, as to whether when the charge is framed only under
Section 304­B of the IPC could the conviction be recorded under
Section 306 of the IPC did not fall for consideration in the said
case.
30. In the case of Thanu Ram vs. State of Madhya
Pradesh8 this Court by observing that on account of interplay
between Section 113­A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and
Sections 498­A, 107 and 306 of the IPC, held that the appellant
was liable for conviction for the offence punishable under
Section 498­A and Section 306 of the IPC. However, it is to be
noted that in the said case the Court relied on the dying
declaration of the deceased wherein she stated that she had
been treated with both mental and physical cruelty. In the said
case, there was a dying declaration of the deceased which was
believed by the court. The said dying declaration was
corroborated by the evidence of PW­13, on the basis of which
8 (2010) 10 SCC 35324
the Court held that the ill treatment was such which triggered
her immediate intention to commit suicide.
31. In the case of Satish Shetty vs. State of Karnataka9
the victim was found to have injuries on her person. Though,
the deceased and the husband had slept together in the same
room before she consumed poison, the appellant­husband had
not at all explained the injuries sustained by the victim. In these
circumstances, the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC, as
recorded by the High Court for the first time, was maintained by
this Court.
32. Insofar as the judgment of this Court in the case of
Narwinder Singh vs. State of Punjab10, it is by the two
learned Judges of this Court and it does not take into
consideration the judgment by three learned Judges of this
Court in Ramesh Kumar (supra)..
33. Applying the aforesaid principles to the present case, we
find that though the prosecution is successful in proving the
case under Section 498­A of the IPC, we are of the view that the
prosecution has failed to prove that the cruelty was of such a
nature which left no choice to the deceased than to commit
suicide. The prosecution has not been in a position to place on
9 (2016) 12 SCC 759
10 (2011) 2 SCC 4725
record any evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt that
any act or omission of the accused instigated the deceased to
commit suicide. There is no material on record to show that
immediately prior to the deceased committing suicide there was
a cruelty meted out to the deceased by the accused due to
which the deceased had no other option than to commit the
suicide. We are of the view, that there is no material placed on
record to reach a cause and effect relationship between the
cruelty and the suicide for the purpose of raising presumption.
34. It could further be seen from the evidence on record that
the time gap between the last visit of the deceased to her
parents with regard to the illegal demand and the date of
commission of suicide is about two months. As such, there is
nothing on record to show that there was a proximate nexus
between the commission of suicide and the illegal demand made
by the appellant. In the case of Sanju Alias Sanjay Singh
Sengar vs. State of M.P.11 this Court found that there was time
gap of 48 hours between the accused telling the deceased ‘to go
and die’ and the deceased ‘committing suicide’. As such, this
Court held that there was no material to establish that the
accused had abetted the suicide committed by the deceased.
11 [ (2002) 5 SCC 371]26
35. Another aspect that needs consideration is that the cases
wherein this Court has held that the conviction under Section
306 of the IPC was tenable though charge was only under
Section 304­B of the IPC, it was found the charge specifically
stated that the deceased was driven to commit suicide on
account of cruelty meted out to the deceased. However, in the
present case, the charge reads thus:
“That you all on 28.9.94 in the area of Village
Bohan, the death of Jaswinder Kaur wife of you,
Gurjit Singh and daughter­in­law of you, Gurdial
Singh and Mohinder Kaur and sister­in­law of Ranjit
Kaur, was caused otherwise than under normal
circumstances, you all being her relatives, within a
period of seven years of her marriage subjected to
her to cruelty and harassment for all in connection
with demand for dowry and thereby committed an
offence of dowry death punishable under section
304­B of the Indian Penal Code, and within my
cognizance.”
36. It would thus be seen, that the charge does not state that
the deceased was driven to commit suicide on account of the
harassment meted out to the deceased. It also does not mention
that the accused had abetted in commission of suicide by the
deceased. In that view of the matter, we are of the considered
view that the cases wherein conversion is held to be permissible
are clearly distinguishable.
37. In the foregoing circumstances, the appeals are partly
allowed. Conviction under Section 498­A of the IPC is27
maintained and the conviction under Section 306 of the IPC is
set aside. The appellant is acquitted of the charge under Section
306 of the IPC.
38. The appellant is stated to be on bail, his bail bonds shall
stand discharged and he is directed to surrender within four
weeks for serving the remaining period of his sentence, if not
already undergone.
