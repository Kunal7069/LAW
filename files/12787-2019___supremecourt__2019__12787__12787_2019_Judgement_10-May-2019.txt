Jitender Kumar @ Jitender Singh ….Appellant(s)
VERSUS
The State of Bihar ….Respondent(s)
J U D G M E N T
Abhay Manohar Sapre, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. This appeal is directed against the final
judgment and order dated 28.03.2019 passed by
the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal
Miscellaneous No.5293 of 2019 whereby the High
1 1Court dismissed the petition filed by the appellant
herein.
3. A few facts need mention hereinbelow for the
disposal of this appeal, which involves a short point.
4. By impugned order, the High Court (Single
Judge) dismissed the petition filed by the appellant
herein under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973 (for short, “Cr.P.C.) and, in
consequence, affirmed the order dated 09.04.2015
passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamui in
connection with P.S. Case No.154 of 2013 whereby
the appellant along was summoned to face Session
Trial No.280 of 2016 pending in the Court of First
Additional & Sessions Judge, Jamui for the offences
punishable under Sections 302, 325, 326, 331, 352
read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860
(for short, “IPC”).
2 25. The short question, which arises for
consideration in this appeal, is whether the High
Court was right in dismissing the appellant's
petition.
6. Heard Ms. Anjana Prakash, learned senior
counsel for the appellant and Ms. Hemlata Ranga,
learned counsel for the respondent­State.
7. Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties and on perusal of the record of the case, we
are inclined to allow this appeal, set aside the
impugned order and remand the case to the High
Court (Single Judge) for deciding the appellant's
petition afresh on merits in accordance with law.
8. The need to remand the case to the High Court
has occasioned because on perusal of the impugned
order, we find that paras 1 to 4 contain facts of the
case, paras 5 and 6 contain the submissions of the
learned counsel for the parties, paras 7 to 9 refer to
3 3what transpired in the Trial Court, paras 10 and 11
contain quotation from two decisions of this Court
and para 12 contains the conclusion, which reads
as under:
“12. After giving analytical thought to the
facts and circumstances of the case, the
instant petition is found devoid of merit,
consequent thereupon is dismissed.”
9. In the entire impugned order, which consists
of 13 paras, we find that the High Court did not
assign any reason as to why the petition is liable to
be dismissed. In other words, neither there is any
discussion and nor the reasoning on the
submissions urged by the learned counsel for the
parties.
10. In our view, such approach of the High Court
while disposing of the petition cannot be
countenanced. Time and again, this Court has
emphasized the necessity of giving reasons in
4 4support of the conclusion because it is the reason,
which indicates the application of mind. It is,
therefore, obligatory for the Court to assign the
reasons as to why the petition is allowed or rejected,
as the case may be.
11. As mentioned above, para 12 only records the
conclusion. It is for this reason, we feel that the
matter must go back to the High Court for deciding
the petition afresh on merits in accordance with
law.
12. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal
succeeds and is accordingly allowed. The impugned
order is set aside. The matter is remanded to the
High Court for deciding the petition, out of which
this appeal arises, afresh on merits in accordance
with law keeping in view the observations made
above.
5 513. We, however, make it clear that we have not
expressed any opinion on the merits of the issues
arising in the case having formed an opinion to
remand the case to the High Court for deciding it
afresh on the ground mentioned above. The High
Court will, therefore, decide the matter on its merits
uninfluenced by any of our observations made in
this order.
14. The parties are granted liberty to mention the
matter in the High Court for its early hearing.
