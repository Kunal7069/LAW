R. Subhash Reddy, J.
1. These two criminal appeals, arising out of
Judgment dated 26.09.1997 passed in Special Case
No.18/1982, by Special Judge C.B.I. (North), Patna, as
such they are heard together and being disposed of by

2. In these appeals, the appellants have challenged
the common judgment in criminal appeal nos. 281 and
1Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
282 of 1997 dated 17.02.2009, passed by the High Court

3. The appellants herein are accused nos. 3 and 1
respectively, in Special Case No. 18 of 1982, before

and 477A read with Section 120B of Indian Penal Code
(IPC) and Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(c) and

under Section 5(1)(c) and (d) of P.C. Act.
5. As there is a conviction recorded and sentence
imposed on the appellants, (Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh)
accused No.3 and accused No. 1 (Ramdeo Prasad), they
have preferred criminal appeal Nos.281 of 1997 and
282 of 1997 respectively before the High Court of
Patna. The High Court, while confirming the conviction
recorded against the appellants, has reduced the
sentence. The appellant in criminal appeal
No.1804/2011 was sentenced to undergo RI for 6 months
under Section 120B, read with Section 409 of I.P.C.
and further sentenced to undergo RI for 6 months under
Section 477A of I.P.C. The said appellant is also

Rs.15,000/- under Section 5(1)(d) read with Section

6. The aforesaid two appeals were disposed of
alongwith appeal filed by accused No.4, i.e, (Ram Nath
Sharma @ Ram Nath Prasad Sharma) in criminal appeal
No. 299/1997 and the appeal filed by accused no.2,
i.e, (Ram Uday Singh). It is brought to our notice
that so far as special leave petition filed by ‘Ram
Nath Sharma’ is concerned, the same is dismissed by
this Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.4005
of 2009, by order dated 24.07.2009.
7. The prosecution case is based on a complaint
dated 23.12.1981 (Ext.8), on the report of S.P. Singh
(PW5), Deputy Manager (Vigilance and Security),
Regional Office, Food Corporation of India (F.C.I.),
Patna. On the basis of the said complaint, First
Information Report (F.I.R)(Ext.9) was registered. It
was the case of the prosecution that, Ramdeo Prasad,
while functioning as Depot Incharge of F.C.I, Tilrath,
4Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
District of Begusarai, has conspired alongwith the
other accused Ramnath Sharma, AG-III, who was working
as Incharge F.C.I, Railway Siding, Barauni and one
Rama Shankar Prasad Singh, the handling/transporting
contractor at F.S.D F.C.I, Tilrath during March, 1980
and have misappropriated 540 bags of
fertilizers(urea). It is alleged that on 24.03.1980,
two wagons bearing nos. NR17797 and NR61690, each
containing 500 and 540 fertilizer bags respectively,
were placed at Barauni Railway Station for the purpose
of unloading. On the same day, the said fertilizer
bags were unloaded and delivery of such goods was
taken by Ramnath Sharma. It is the further case of
prosecution that Ramdeo Prasad, AG-I was posted as
Depot Incharge, F.S.D, F.C.I, at Tilrath during 1980
and he was the overall Incharge of the Depot and
personally responsible for the safety of all the stock
and also proper maintainence of records of the godown.
It is alleged that Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh was
functioning as AG-III and he was Incharge of receipt
of the consignment in the Depot. It is the case of the
5Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
prosecution that 500 bags and 540 bags of urea which
were loaded from Madras and Cuttack respectively, were
received at Barauni and both wagons were placed in the
Railway siding for giving delivery to FCI staff posted
at Railway Station on 24.03.1980. It is the case of
the prosecution that Ramnath Sharma took delivery of
1040 bags of urea on 25.03.1980 from Railway Station,
Barauni and has put his signature on delivery book in
token of having received the consignment vide page
nos. 12 and 13 of Railway Delivery Book on 24.03.1980
and 25.03.1980.
8. It is further alleged that Ramnath Prasad Sharma
handed over 500 bags of urea to Ram Uday Singh
representative of Rama Shankar Singh on 24.03.1980,
who signed in two gate passes bearing nos. 14791 and
14792, issued by Ramnath Prasad Sharma for
transportation of 500 bags of urea vide truck nos.
BRI-7851 and BHF-3155. It is the case of the
prosecution, as stated in the charge-sheet, that the
abovesaid consignment of 500 bags of urea which is
allegedly transported in two trucks bearing nos. BRI-
6Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
7851 and BHF-3155, with 250 bags of urea each, have
not been taken to the F.C.I. godown at Tilrath.
However, the appellants have falsified the records of
main gate register (Ext.6), Arrival Tally Book, ‘G’-
Form and ‘O’-Form dated 24th/25th of March, 1980. The
said 500 bags were shown to have been received in the
godown by Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh, AG-III, which are
also signed by Ramdeo Prasad and the said documents
were prepared on the basis of Inward Register, F.C.I,
F.S.D, Tilrath in which Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh has
shown the arrival of truck nos. (as mentioned above)
with 250 bags of urea each. It is the further case of
the prosecution that the investigation disclosed that
though the remaining 540 bags of urea received by
Ramnath Sharma, are alleged to have dispatched with
270 bags of urea each in the trucks, but such quantity
was criminally misappropriated by all the accused who
have conspired for such misappropriation.
9. To prove the guilt of the appellants herein, the
prosecution has examined 21 witnesses. PW-1

10. On behalf of the defence, one Mr. Anand Mohan
Sahay, was examined as DW-1, who is retired as
Assistant Depot Manager of FCI.
9Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
11. We have heard Mr. Santosh Mishra and Ms.
Aparajita Singh, learned counsels for the appellants
and Mr. Ashok Kumar Shrivastava and Mr. P.K. Dey,
learned counsel appearing for the CBI.
12. In these appeals, it is contended by the learned
counsel for the appellants that the High Court failed
to appreciate the entire material on record,
deposition of all witnesses, who were employees of
FCI, who have deposed that 500 bags of urea reached
the godown on 24th/25th of March, 1980, which is
further supported by an Audit Report.
13. It is contended that though, the prosecution has
mainly relied on the evidence of PW-9, PW-10 and
PW-14, truck driver, Khalasi(cleaner) and owner
respectively of truck bearing no.BHF-3155, PW-15 and
PW-18, the owner and the driver respectively of truck
bearing no. BRI-7851, in arriving at the conclusion
that 500 bags were not delivered at Tilrath godown,
but on a fair perusal of the evidence of the said
witnesses, there were several inconsistencies and
contradictions. It is submitted that in view of such
10Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
inconsistencies, in deposition of the witnesses
referred above, the Trial Court as well as the High
Court has committed an error in relying on the
testimony of such witnesses. It is further the case of
the appellants that the prosecution has failed to show
that there was misappropriation of 1040 bags. On the
contrary, the documentary and oral evidence on record
suggests that there was complaint of misappropriation
of 540 bags only.
14. In view of such allegation, the question of mode
of transportation of 500 bags does not remain
important and the Trial Court as well as the High
Court should not have relied on the evidence of the
witnesses, related to transportation of 500 bags. It
is submitted that the FIR was lodged with regard to
only 540 bags but not with regard to 1040 bags of
urea, as alleged by the prosecution.
15. By referring to the document under Ex.24, it is
contended that the said document clearly reveals the
delivery of 500 bags of urea in Tilrath godown on
25.03.1980. Further, by referring to the depositions
11Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
of PW-4 and PW-20, it is stated that such witnesses
were involved in the preparation of documents after
weighing, counting and stacking of the bags, were
competent witnesses, who have deposed the factum of
receipt of 500 bags on 24th/25th of March, 1980. It is
the case of the appellants that the Trial Court and
the High Court ought not to have discarded the
evidence of PW-4 and PW-20 in coming to the conclusion
that the appellants are guilty for offences alleged.
It is submitted that the evidence of PW-4 and PW-20
was not relied on surmises and conjectures, without
appreciating such evidence which is not challenged by
the prosecution. It is stated that even as per the
documentary evidence adduced by the prosecution,
arrival tally book (‘D’ Form), daily receipt register
(‘G’ Form) and Godown stock register (‘O’ Form) were
maintained by different officers based on the entry
made by Shiv Shankar Singh in the main gate register.
16. Learned counsels, by taking us to the oral and
documentary evidence on record, have submitted that
though there is no consistency in the evidence
12Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
recorded by the prosecution and the prosecution has
failed to establish the offence alleged against the
appellants, the Trial Court has erroneously convicted
them for the offences alleged, same is also confirmed
by the High Court without appreciating the evidence on
record in proper perspective.
17. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for
the State, by referring to oral and documentary
evidence on record, has submitted that the evidence
adduced by the prosecution is consistent and the
prosecution has proved the guilt of the appellants
beyond reasonable doubt. It is submitted that though
initially a complaint was lodged, based upon which,
the F.I.R. was registered alleging that out of 1040
bags of fertilizer, there was misappropriation of only
540 bags of fertilizer, but after the investigation,
it revealed that entire 1040 bags of fertilizer were
misappropriated, of which, false entries were made to
the extent of 500 bags in the records of the F.C.I.
godown at Tilrath, so as to show as if 500 bags of
urea were arrived. In this regard, the gate
13Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
pass/register which was to be maintained by the
appellant, i.e, Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh, he has
falsified the entries with regard to receipt of such
500 bags of fertilizer. Equally, the appellant,
namely, Ramdeo Prasad has also falsified the entries
which are maintained by him and the ‘G’-Form and
godown stock register in ‘O’-Form, were tampered and
false entries were made to show that such 500 bags of
fertilizer were arrived and unloaded. It is submitted
from the oral and documentary evidence on record that
the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt,
the conspiracy of all the accused who have committed
criminal breach of trust by falsification of accounts.
It is submitted, in view of such overwhelming
evidence, the Trial Court has rightly convicted and
the High Court has rightly confirmed the conviction
against the appellants and there are no grounds to
interfere with such concurrent findings recorded by
the courts below. It is also submitted that having
regard to the evidence on record, it cannot be said
that the findings recorded are either perverse or
14Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
erroneous, so as to interfere with the same. Learned
counsel submitted that the appeals lack merit and
deserve to be dismissed.
18. Having heard the learned counsel for the
parties, we have perused the impugned judgments and
the oral and documentary evidence on record.
19. At the outset, it is to be noted that the
initial complaint was lodged alleging misappropriation
of only 540 bags of urea but investigation revealed
that entire 1040 bags of urea was misappropriated. It
is the specific allegation of the prosecution that the
appellants and other accused have conspired with
criminal intent and indulged in falsification of
accounts. Out of 1040 bags of urea, 500 bags were
shown to have loaded in the trucks bearing nos.BRI-
7851 and BHF-3155 with 250 bags each for delivering
the same at F.C.I. godown at Tilrath but it was found
that there was no actual delivery of such fertiliser
bags and the F.C.I. records were falsified. The
specific case of the prosecution against Shiv Shankar
Prasad Singh, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1804
15Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
of 2011 is that he was responsible for making entries
in the register at the gate and he has made false
entries of arrival of such 500 bags of urea though
such fertiliser was not actually delivered. Similarly
and correspondingly, in the further registers in ‘O’
Form and ‘G’ Form, false entries were made for which
Ramdeo Prasad is responsible. Merely because
misappropriation of 540 bags of urea is mentioned in
the initial complaint, we cannot ignore the
chargesheet which was filed after investigation which
revealed misappropriation of entire qualtity of 1040
bags of urea. Same is clear from the deposition of
the investigating officer who was examined as P.W.21.
It is clear from the evidence on record, that so far
as 500 bags of urea are concerned though they were
loaded in the two trucks bearing nos.BRI-7851 and BHF-
3155 but they were not taken to the F.C.I. godown at
Tilrath and false entries were made in the main gate
register and other registers which are being
maintained in ‘O’ Form and ‘G’ Form to show as if such
quantity of fertiliser was delivered.
16Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
20. It is not in dispute that the appellant, Shiv
Shankar Singh was functioning as AG-III during the
relevant time and he was incharge of receipt of
consignment at the Depot. Further evidence also makes
it clear that the appellant Shiv Shankar Prasad Singh
has shown arrival of trucks bearing BRI-7851 and BHF-
3155 on 25.03.1980 with 250 bags of urea each. It is
also clear from the evidence on record that the
physical verification was carried out between
06.10.1982 and 06.11.1982 and just prior to that,
chart (Ext.24) was brought into existence on
01.10.1982, indicating that 500 bags of urea were
delivered in two trucks. It is the case of the
prosecution that the document which is prepared under
Ext.24 (the chart) is not a document which is required
to be maintained in the official course of business
and same is got prepared only to show that the stock
of fertiliser is arrived at, though actually it was
not brought. So far as deposition of PW-17, i.e, of
Ram Sagar Paswan is concerned, same is not relied on
by the prosecution and he was declared hostile.
17Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
21. Learned counsel for the appellants has made much
emphasis on the evidence of PW-4 and PW-20, who have
spoken about the delivery of 500 bags of urea on
25.03.1980 on the basis of Ext.24, but it is to be
noted that such document under Ext.24 is a document
which is prepared much after filing of the FIR. The
incident has occurred in the month of March 1980 and
the document under Ext.24 was brought into existence
only on 01.10.1982. The said evidence if considered
alongwith the other oral and documentary evidence on
record, it falsifies the case of the appellants. It
is also clear from the evidence on record that one of
the trucks was, in fact, used for transporting 250
bags of urea on 25.03.1980, but instead of delivering
the said bags at FSD FCI, Tilrath, the truck was
diverted and such commodity of fertiliser was
delivered at Manjhaul which is a different place. It
is also clear from the evidence on record, another
truck bearing no.BRI-7851 which is allegedly used in
carrying 250 bags of urea was never employed at all
for carrying fertiliser. There is no reason to
18Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
discard such positive evidence on record which
clinchingly proved the guilt of the accused. The
trial court as well as the appellate court has rightly
relied upon deposition of owners, driver and khalasi
of the vehicles in question.
22. Considering the totality of oral and documentary
evidence on record, we are of the view that the
prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt. Having regard to evidence on record,
it cannot be said that findings recorded by the trial
court, as affirmed by the appellate court, are either
perverse or erroneous so as to interfere with the
same. Apart from the allegation of misappropriation
with criminal intent there is specific case of the
prosecution that all the accused have conspired and
are punishable for offence under Section 120B of the
I.P.C. It is further to be noted that Special Leave
Petition being SLP(Crl.) No.4005 of 2009 filed by the
other accused, i.e, Ram Nath Sharma @ Ram Nath Prasad
Sharma is already dismissed by this Court, at the
19Crl.A. No.1804 of 2011 etc.
stage of Special Leave Petition, by order dated
24.07.2009.
23. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not find any
merit in these appeals, same are accordingly
dismissed. Consequently, the bail bonds of the
appellants stand cancelled. The appellants shall
surrender to serve the remaining sentence, within a
period of four weeks from today. Failing such
surrender within the time, it is open to the
respondents to take necessary steps against the
accused.
