CRIMINAL APPEAL No.1239 OF 1999
RAM SWARUP Appellant (s)
VERSUShttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 2
MOHD. JAVED RAZACK & ANR Respondent(s)
B.P. SINGH,J.
In this appeal by special leave the appellant has impugned the order of the High
Court of Judicature at Andhra Pradesh, Hyderabad in Criminal Petition No.5314 of 1998 dated
8th June, 1999 whereby the application filed by the appellant under Section 482 of the Code
of
Criminal Procedure for quashing the order of the XVTH Metropolitan Magistrate, Hyderabad
taking cognizance was rejected.
We may notice that a complaint was filed by the respondent before the Metropolitan
Magistrate complaining that when he had gone to the chambers of the appellant, he had
addressed him and his father in abusive language in the presence of several persons. We nee
d
not reproduce the words used but it is clear to us on a reading of the complaint that the wo
rds
used are defamatory per se, particularly, when a vice-president of the Income tax appellate
tribunal is said to have addressed those words to a practicing lawyer and to the father o
f the
complainant, who was also a member of the Income tax appellate tribunal.
It is argued before us that cognizance taken by the Metropolitan Magistrate of an
offence under Sections 499 and 503 IPC is not warranted, and in any event, before taking
cognizance the Magistrate ought to have referred the matter to the police under Section 156(
3) of
the Code of Criminal Procedure for investigation by the police. We are not impressed by th
e
argument. The magistrate after examining the complaintant on oath came to the conclusion,
prima facie, that an offence was made out. We find no fault with the Metropolitan Magistra
te
so far as this aspect of the matter is concerned. Moreover, since the Magistrate has exerci
sed his
power to take cognizance, the same cannot be faulted on the ground that he had not referred
the
matter to the police for investigation under Section 156(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedu
re. It
was submitted before that the imputations are mainly against the father of the complainant a
nd,
therefore, a complaint ought to have been made by the father of the complainant. Reference
was
made to provisions of Section 199 of Cr.P.C. On perusal of the complaint, we find that simi
lar
defamatory words were used against the complainant also apart from his father and, therefore
,
the right of the complainant to move the court and lodge a complaint before the competent
magistrate cannot be challenged.
In the result, we find no merit in the appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed
.
