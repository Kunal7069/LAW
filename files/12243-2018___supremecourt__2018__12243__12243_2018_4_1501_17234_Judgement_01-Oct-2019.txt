ARUN MISHRA, J.
1. The Union of India has filed the instant petition for review of the
judgment and order dated 20.3.2018 passed by this Court in Criminal
Appeal No.416 of 2018. This Court while dealing with the provisions
of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of
Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short ‘the Act of 1989’) has issued guidelines
in paragraph 83 of the judgment, which are extracted hereunder:­
“83. Our conclusions are as follows:
i) Proceedings in the present case are clear abuse of process of
court and are quashed.
ii) There is no absolute bar against grant of anticipatory bail in
cases under the Atrocities Act if no prima facie case is made out
1or where on judicial scrutiny the complaint is found to be prima
facie mala fide. We approve the view taken and approach of the
Gujarat High Court in Pankaj D Suthar (supra) and Dr. N.T.
Desai (supra) and clarify the judgments of this Court in
Balothia (supra) and Manju Devi (supra);
iii) In view of acknowledged abuse of law of arrest in cases under
the Atrocities Act, arrest of a public servant can only be after
approval of the appointing authority and of a non­public servant
after approval by the S.S.P. which may be granted in appropriate
cases if considered necessary for reasons recorded. Such reasons
must be scrutinized by the Magistrate for permitting further
detention.
iv) To avoid false implication of an innocent, a preliminary
enquiry may be conducted by the DSP concerned to find out
whether the allegations make out a case under the Atrocities Act
and that the allegations are not frivolous or motivated.
v) Any violation of direction (iii) and (iv) will be actionable by way
of disciplinary action as well as contempt.
The above directions are prospective.”
2. This Court, while passing the judgment under review, has
observed in paragraph 32 thus:
“32. This Court is not expected to adopt a passive or negative role
and remain bystander or a spectator if violation of rights is
observed. It is necessary to fashion new tools and strategies so as to
check injustice and violation of fundamental rights. No procedural
technicality can stand in the way of enforcement of fundamental
rights1. There are enumerable decisions of this Court where this
approach has been adopted and directions issued with a view to
enforce fundamental rights which may sometimes be perceived as
legislative in nature. Such directions can certainly be issued and
continued till an appropriate legislation is enacted2. Role of this
Court travels beyond merely dispute settling and directions can
certainly be issued which are not directly in conflict with a valid
statute3. Power to declare law carries with it, within the limits of
duty, to make law when none exists4 .

[Note: For convenience, the cases/citations in the extracts have been renumbered.]
23. Question has been raised by the Union of India that when the
Court does not accept the legislative and specific provisions of law
passed by the legislature and only the legislature has the power to
amend those provisions if the Court finds provisions are not
acceptable to it, it has to be struck them down being violative of
fundamental rights or in case of deficiency to point out to the
legislature to correct the same.
4. The Union of India has submitted that judgment and order dated
20.3.2018 entails wide ramification and it deserves to be reviewed by
this Court. It is also submitted that this Court has failed to take note
of aspects which would have a significant bearing on the present case.
5. It is submitted that the Act of 1989 had been enacted to remove
the disparity of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who
remain vulnerable and denied their civil rights. The Statement of
Objects and Reasons of the Act of 1989, for which it had been enacted
is as under:
"Despite various measures to improve the socio­economic
conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes,
they remain vulnerable. They are denied number of civil rights.
They are subjected to various offences, indignities,
humiliations, and harassment. They have, in several brutal
incidents, been deprived of their life and property. Serious
crimes are committed against them for various historical,
social, and economic reasons.
2. ………. When they assert their rights and resist practices of
untouchability against them or demand statutory minimum
wages or refuse to do any bonded and forced labour, the
vested interests try to cow them down and terrorise them.
3When the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes try to
preserve their self­respect or honour of their women, they
become irritants for the dominant and the mighty. Occupation
and cultivation of even the Government allotted land by the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is resented and more
often these people become victims of attacks by the vested
interests. Of late, there has been an increase in the disturbing
trend of the commission of certain atrocities like making the
Scheduled Caste persons ear inedible substances, like human
excreta and attacks on and mass killings of helpless
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and rape of
women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes. Under the circumstances, the existing laws like the
Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955 and the normal provisions
of the Indian Penal Code have been found to be inadequate to
check these crimes. A special legislation to check and deter
crimes against them committed by non­Scheduled Castes and
non­Scheduled Tribes has, therefore, become necessary."
The preamble to the Act of 1989 states as under:
“An Act to prevent the Commission of offences of atrocities
against the members of the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes, to provide for special courts for the trial of
such offences and for the relief and rehabilitation of the
victims of such offences and for matters connected therewith
or incidental thereto.”
Section 18 of the Act of 1989 has been enacted to take care of an
inherent deterrence and to instil a sense of protection amongst
members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. It is submitted
that any dilution of the same would shake the very objective of the
mechanism to prevent the offences of atrocities. The directions issued
would cause a miscarriage of justice even in deserving cases. With a
view to object apprehended misuse of the law, no such direction can
be issued. In case there is no prima facie case made out under the
Act of 1989, anticipatory bail can be granted. The same was granted
in the case in question also.
46. It is submitted that because of the continuing atrocities against
the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, a
commission of offences against them indicated an increase, even the
existing provisions were not considered sufficient to achieve the
objective to deliver equal justice to the members of the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Hence, the Act of 1989 had been
amended in April 2015, enforced with effect from 26.01.2016.
7. It is further submitted that the amendments broadly related to
addition of several new offences/atrocities like tonsuring of
head/moustache, or similar acts which are derogatory to the dignity of
the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, garlanding
with footwear, denying access to irrigation facilities or forest rights,
dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, or to dig graves, using or
permitting manual scavenging, dedicating a Scheduled Caste or a
Scheduled Tribe woman as devadasi, abusing in caste name,
perpetrating witchcraft atrocities, imposing social or economic boycott,
preventing Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe candidates from
filing nomination to contest elections, insulting a Scheduled Castes/
Scheduled Tribes woman by removing her garments, forcing a member
of Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribe to leave house, village or
residence, defiling objects sacred to members of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes, touching or using acts or gestures of a sexual
5nature against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
and addition of certain IPC offences like hurt, grievous hurt,
intimidation, kidnapping etc., attracting less than ten years of
imprisonment committed against members of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes as offences punishable under the Act of 1989, beside
rephrasing and expansion of some of the earlier offences.
8. It is submitted that the provisions have also been made for the
establishment of exclusive Special Courts and specification of
Exclusive Special Public Prosecutors to exclusively try the offences
under the Act of 1989 to enable expeditious disposal of cases, Special
Courts and Exclusive Special Courts to take direct cognisance of
offences and completion of trial as far as possible within two months
from the date of filing of the charge sheet and addition of chapter on
the “Rights of Victims and Witnesses”.
9. It is also submitted on behalf of Union of India that as per the
amendment Rules, 2016 the provisions have also been made with
regard to relief amount of 47 offences of atrocities to victims,
rationalisation of the phasing of payment of relief amount,
enhancement of relief amount between Rs.85,000/­ to Rs.8,25,000/­
depending upon the nature of the offence, payment of admissible relief
within seven days, on completion of investigation and filing of charge
sheet within sixty days to enable timely commencement of prosecution
6and periodic review of the scheme for the rights and entitlements of
victims and witnesses in accessing justice by the State, District and
Sub­Division Level Vigilance and Monitoring Committees in their
respective meetings.
10. It is submitted that this Court has failed to appreciate that low
rate of conviction and high rate of acquittal under the Act of 1989,
related cases is attributable to several factors like delay in lodging the
FIR, witnesses, and complainants becoming hostile, absence of proper
scrutiny of the cases by the prosecution before filing the charge sheet
in the Court, lack of proper presentation of the case by the
prosecution and appreciation of evidence by the Court. There is long
pendency of the trial, which makes the witness to lose their interest
and lack of corroborative evidence. There are procedural delays in
investigation and filing of the charge sheet.
11. It is submitted that Rule 7(2) of Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 provides that
investigating officer to complete the investigation within 30 days.
Without immediate registration of FIR and arrest and by providing
anticipatory bail to the accused, Rule 7 is bound to be frustrated.
12. It is further submitted that the directions issued are legislative.
It would devoid the object of the Act to remove the caste­based sub­
7judication and discrimination. Such directions are impermissible to
be issued under Article 142 of the Constitution of India.
13. It is also submitted that offences of atrocities against the
members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have been
disturbingly continuing and as per the data of National Crime Records
Bureau (NCRB), Ministry of Home Affairs, 47,338 number of cases
were registered in the country under the Act of 1989 in conjunction
with the Indian Penal Code during the year 2016. Further, only 24.5
% of the said cases ended in conviction and 89.3% were pending in the
courts at the end of the year 2016. In the circumstances, it is not
proper to dilute the provisions and make it easier for the accused to
get away from arrest by directing a preliminary enquiry, approval for
an arrest.
14. Per contra, it is submitted that directions are proper because of
misuse of the legislative provisions of the Atrocities Act, and no case
for interference is made out in the review jurisdiction.
15. Before dealing with submission, we refer to the decisions. In
National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights & Ors v. Union of India &
Ors. (2017) 2 SCC 432, this Court has considered the report of Justice
K. Punnaiah Commission and the 6th Report of the National
Commission for Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes. The NHRC
8report also highlighted the non­registration of cases and various other
machinations resorted to by the police to discourage Dalits from
registering cases under the Act of 1989. In the said case this Court
had directed the strict implementation of the provisions of the Act of
1989. The relevant portion of the decision mentioned above is
extracted hereunder:
"18. We have carefully examined the material on record, and we are
of the opinion that there has been a failure on the part of the
authorities concerned in complying with the provisions of the Act
and the Rules. The laudable object with which the Act had been
made is defeated by the indifferent attitude of the authorities. It is
true that the State Governments are responsible for carrying out the
provisions of the Act as contended by the counsel for the Union of
India. At the same time, the Central Government has an important
role to play in ensuring the compliance with the provisions of the
Act. Section 21(4) of the Act provides for a report on the measures
taken by the Central Government and State Governments for the
effective implementation of the Act to be placed before Parliament
every year. The constitutional goal of equality for all the citizens of
this country can be achieved only when the rights of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes are protected. The abundant material
on record proves that the authorities concerned are guilty of not
enforcing the provisions of the Act. The travails of the members of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes continue unabated.
We are satisfied that the Central Government and the State
Governments should be directed to strictly enforce the provisions of
the Act and we do so. The National Commissions are also directed
to discharge their duties to protect the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. …."
16. Reliance has been placed on Lalita Kumari v. Government of U.P.,
(2014) 2 SCC 1, wherein a Constitution Bench of this Court has
observed as under:
“35. However, on the other hand, there are a number of cases
which exhibit that there are instances where the power of the police
to register an FIR and initiate an investigation thereto are misused
where a cognizable offence is not made out from the contents of the
complaint. A significant case in this context is the case of Preeti
Gupta v. State of Jharkhand (2010) 7 SCC 667 wherein this Court
has expressed its anxiety over misuse of Section 498­A of the Penal
9Code, 1860 (in short “IPC”) with respect to which a large number of
frivolous reports were lodged. This Court expressed its desire that
the legislature must take into consideration the informed public
opinion and the pragmatic realities to make necessary changes in
law.
36. The abovesaid judgment resulted in the 243rd Report of the Law
Commission of India submitted on 30­8­2012. The Law
Commission, in its report, concluded that though the offence under
Section 498­A could be made compoundable, however, the extent of
misuse was not established by empirical data, and, thus, could not
be a ground to denude the provision of its efficacy. The Law
Commission also observed that the law on the question whether the
registration of FIR could be postponed for a reasonable time is in a
state of uncertainty and can be crystallised only upon this Court
putting at rest the present controversy.”
***
99. In CBI v. Tapan Kumar Singh (2003) 6 SCC 175, it was held as
under: (SCC pp. 183­84, para 20)
“20. ……If he has reasons to suspect, on the basis of
information received, that a cognizable offence may have been
committed, he is bound to record the information and conduct
an investigation. At this stage, it is also not necessary for him
to satisfy himself about the truthfulness of the information. It
is only after a complete investigation that he may be able to
report on the truthfulness or otherwise of the information.
…..The true test is whether the information furnished provides
a reason to suspect the commission of an offence, which the
police officer concerned is empowered under Section 156 of
the Code to investigate. If it does, he has no option but to
record the information and proceed to investigate the case
either himself or depute any other competent officer to
conduct the investigation…..”
It is apparent from the decision in Lalita Kumari (supra) that FIR
has to be registered forthwith in case it relates to the commission of
the cognizable offence. There is no discretion on the Officer In­charge
of the Police Station for embarking upon a preliminary inquiry before
registration of FIR. Preliminary inquiry can only be held in a case
where it has to be ascertained whether a cognizable offence has been
committed or not. If the information discloses the commission of a
cognizable offence, it is mandatory to register the FIR under Section
10154 of Cr.PC, and no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a
situation. This Court in Lalita Kumar (supra) observed as under:
“54. Therefore, the context in which the word “shall” appears in
Section 154(1) of the Code, the object for which it has been used
and the consequences that will follow from the infringement of the
direction to register FIRs, all these factors clearly show that the
word “shall” used in Section 154(1) needs to be given its ordinary
meaning of being of “mandatory” character. The provisions of
Section 154(1) of the Code, read in the light of the statutory scheme,
do not admit of conferring any discretion on the officer in charge of
the police station for embarking upon a preliminary inquiry prior to
the registration of an FIR. It is settled position of law that if the
provision is unambiguous and the legislative intent is clear, the
court need not call into it any other rules of construction.”
Concerning the question of arrest, in Lalita Kumari (supra) this
Court has considered the safeguard in respect of arrest of an accused
person. This Court affirmed the principle that arrest cannot be made
routinely on the mere allegation of commission of an offence. The
question arises as to justification to create a special dispensation
applicable only to complaints under the Atrocities Act because of
safeguards applicable generally.
17. In State of Haryana & Ors. v. Bhajan Lal & Ors., 1992 Supp (1)
SCC 335, which has been relied upon in Lalita Kumari (supra), this
Court has observed as under:
“31. At the stage of registration of a crime or a case on the basis of
the information disclosing a cognizable offence in compliance with
the mandate of Section 154(1) of the Code, the concerned police
officer cannot embark upon an enquiry as to whether the
information, laid by the informant is reliable and genuine or
otherwise and refuse to register a case on the ground that the
information is not reliable or credible. On the other hand, the officer
in charge of a police station is statutorily obliged to register a case
and then to proceed with the investigation if he has reason to
suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under
11Section 156 of the Code to investigate, subject to the proviso to
Section 157. (As we have proposed to make a detailed discussion
about the power of a police officer in the field of investigation of a
cognizable offence within the ambit of Sections 156 and 157 of the
Code in the ensuing part of this judgment, we do not propose to
deal with those sections in extenso in the present context.) In case,
an officer in charge of a police station refuses to exercise the
jurisdiction vested in him and to register a case on the information
of a cognizable offence reported and thereby violates the statutory
duty cast upon him, the person aggrieved by such refusal can send
the substance of the information in writing and by post to the
Superintendent of Police concerned who if satisfied that the
information forwarded to him discloses a cognizable offence, should
either investigate the case himself or direct an investigation to be
made by any police officer subordinate to him in the manner
provided by sub­section (3) of Section 154 of the Code.
32. Be it noted that in Section 154(1) of the Code, the legislature in
its collective wisdom has carefully and cautiously used the
expression “information” without qualifying the same as in Section
41(1)(a) or (g) of the Code wherein the expressions, “reasonable
complaint” and “credible information” are used. Evidently, the non­
qualification of the word “information” in Section 154(1) unlike in
Section 41(1)(a) and (g) of the Code may be for the reason that the
police officer should not refuse to record an information relating to
the commission of a cognizable offence and to register a case
thereon on the ground that he is not satisfied with the
reasonableness or credibility of the information. In other words,
‘reasonableness’ or ‘credibility’ of the said information is not a
condition precedent for registration of a case. A comparison of the
present Section 154 with those of the earlier Codes will indicate that
the legislature had purposely thought it fit to employ only the word
“information” without qualifying the said word. Section 139 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure of 1861 (Act 25 of 1861) passed by the
Legislative Council of India read that ‘every complaint or information’
preferred to an officer in charge of a police station should be
reduced into writing which provision was subsequently modified by
Section 112 of the Code of 1872 (Act 10 of 1872) which thereafter
read that ‘every complaint’ preferred to an officer in charge of a
police station shall be reduced in writing. The word ‘complaint’
which occurred in previous two Codes of 1861 and 1872 was
deleted and in that place the word ‘information’ was used in the
Codes of 1882 and 1898 which word is now used in Sections 154,
155, 157 and 190(c) of the present Code of 1973 (Act 2 of 1974). An
overall reading of all the Codes makes it clear that the condition
which is sine qua non for recording a first information report is that
there must be an information and that information must disclose a
cognizable offence.
33. It is, therefore, manifestly clear that if any information
disclosing a cognizable offence is laid before an officer in charge of a
police station satisfying the requirements of Section 154(1) of the
Code, the said police officer has no other option except to enter the
12substance thereof in the prescribed form, that is to say, to register a
case on the basis of such information.”
The Court observed the conduct of an investigation into an
offence after the registration of FIR is a procedure established by law
and conforms with Article 21 of the Constitution. This Court has also
considered possible misuse of the provisions of the law in Lalita
Kumari (supra).
18. On behalf of Union of India, the decision in State of M.P. v. Ram
Krishna Balothia (1995) 3 SCC 221 has been relied on, in which this
Court has upheld the validity of Section 18 of the Act of 1989 and
observed in background relating to the practice of untouchability and
the social attitude which lead to the commission of such offences
against the Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes, there is justification
of apprehension that if benefit of anticipatory bail is made available to
persons who are alleged to have committed such offences, there is
every possibility of their misusing that liberty while on anticipatory
bail to terrorise their victims and to prevent a proper investigation.
This Court in Ram Krishna Balothia’s (supra) has observed:
“6. It is undoubtedly true that Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, which is available to an accused in respect of offences
under the Penal Code, is not available in respect of offences under
the said Act. But can this be considered as violative of Article 14?
The offences enumerated under the said Act fall into a separate and
special class. Article 17 of the Constitution expressly deals with the
abolition of ‘untouchability' and forbids its practice in any form. It
also provides that enforcement of any disability arising out of
‘untouchability' shall be an offence punishable under the law. The
offences, therefore, which are enumerated under Section 3(1) arise
13out of the practice of ‘untouchability.' It is in this context that
certain special provisions have been made in the said Act, including
the impugned provision under Section 18 which is before us. The
exclusion of Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in
connection with offences under the Act has to be viewed in the
context of the prevailing social conditions which give rise to such
offences, and the apprehension that perpetrators of such atrocities
are likely to threaten and intimidate their victims and prevent or
obstruct them in the prosecution of these offenders, if the offenders
are allowed to avail of anticipatory bail. In this connection we may
refer to the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities)
Bill, 1989, when it was introduced in Parliament. It sets out the
circumstances surrounding the enactment of the said Act and
points to the evil which the statute sought to remedy. In the
Statement of Objects and Reasons, it is stated:
"Despite various measures to improve the socio­economic
conditions of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes,
they remain vulnerable. They are denied number of civil rights.
They are subjected to various offences, indignities, humiliations,
and harassment. They have, in several brutal incidents, been
deprived of their life and property. Serious crimes are committed
against them for various historical, social and economic reasons
2. … When they assert their rights and resist practices of
untouchability against them or demand statutory minimum
wages or refuse to do any bonded and forced labour, the vested
interests try to cow them down and terrorise them. When the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes try to preserve their
self­respect or honour of their women, they become irritants for
the dominant and the mighty. Occupation and cultivation of
even the Government allotted land by the Scheduled Castes, and
Scheduled Tribes is resented, and more often these people
become victims of attacks by the vested interests. Of late, there
has been an increase in the disturbing trend of commission of
certain atrocities like making the Scheduled Caste persons eat
inedible substances like human excreta and attacks on and
mass killings of helpless Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
and rape of women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and the
Scheduled Tribes…. A special legislation to check and deter
crimes against them committed by non­Scheduled Castes and
non­Scheduled Tribes has, therefore, become necessary."
The above statement graphically describes the social conditions
which motivated the said legislation. It is pointed out in the above
Statement of Objects and Reasons that when members of the
Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes assert their rights and
demand statutory protection, vested interests try to cow them down
and terrorise them. In these circumstances, if anticipatory bail is
not made available to persons who commit such offences, such a
denial cannot be considered as unreasonable or violative of Article
14, as these offences form a distinct class by themselves and cannot
be compared with other offences.
149. Of course, the offences enumerated under the present case are
very different from those under the Terrorist and Disruptive
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987. However, looking to the historical
background relating to the practice of “Untouchability” and the
social attitudes which lead to the commission of such offences
against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, there is
justification of an apprehension that if the benefit of the
anticipatory bail is made available to the persons who are alleged to
have committed such offences, there is every likelihood of their
misusing their liberty while on anticipatory bail to terrorise their
victims and to prevent a proper investigation. It is in this context
that Section 18 has been incorporated in the said Act. It cannot be
considered as in any manner violative of Article 21.
10. It was submitted before us that while Section 438 is available
for graver offences under the Penal Code, it is not available for even
“minor offences” under the said Act. This grievance also cannot be
justified. The offences which are enumerated under Section 3 are
offences which, to say the least, denigrate members of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the eyes of society, and prevent
them from leading a life of dignity and self­respect. Such offences
are committed to humiliate and subjugate members of Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes with a view to keeping them in a state
of servitude. These offences constitute a separate class and cannot
be compared with offences under the Penal Code.”
19. In Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab, (1994) 3 SCC 569, this Court
has observed that denial of the right of anticipatory bail under section
438 would not amount to a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution
of India. Thus, the provision of section 18 cannot be said to be
violative of Article 21. Article 17 of the Constitution abolishes
untouchability.
20. In Subramanian Swamy & Ors. v. Raju (2014) 8 SCC 390, it is
observed that where statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous,
it cannot be read down and has observed that the statistics are to be
considered by a legislature. The Court must take care not to express
any opinions on sufficiency or adequacy of such figures and should
15confine their scrutiny to legality not a necessity of law. This Court
observed:
"67. Before parting, we would like to observe that elaborate
statistics have been laid before us to show the extent of serious
crimes committed by juveniles and the increase in the rate of such
crimes, of late. We refuse to be tempted to enter into the said arena,
which is primarily for the legislature to consider. Courts must take
care not to express opinions on the sufficiency or adequacy of such
figures and should confine its scrutiny to the legality and not the
necessity of the law to be made or continued. We would be justified
to recall the observations of Justice Krishna Iyer in Murthy Match
Works (1974) 4 SCC 428, as the present issues seem to be
adequately taken care of by the same: (SCC p. 437, paras 13­15)
"13. Right at the threshold, we must warn ourselves of the
limitations of judicial power in this jurisdiction. Mr. Justice
Stone of the Supreme Court of the United States has
delineated these limitations in United States v. Butler: 80L Ed
477: 297 US 1 (1936) thus: (L.Ed p. 495)
"The power of Courts to declare a statute
unconstitutional is subject to two guiding principles of
decision which ought never to be absent from judicial
consciousness. One is that Courts are concerned only
with the power to enact statutes, not with their wisdom.
The other is that while unconstitutional exercise of power
by the executive and legislative branches of the
Government is subject to judicial restraint, the only
check upon our exercise of power is our own sense of
self­restraint. For the removal of unwise laws from the
statute books appeal lies not to the Courts but to the
ballot and to the processes of democratic Government."
14. In short, unconstitutionality and not unwisdom of a
legislation is the narrow area of judicial review. In the present
case, unconstitutionality is alleged as springing from lugging
together two dissimilar categories of match manufacturers into
one compartment for like treatment.
15. Certain principles which bear upon classification may be
mentioned here. It is true that a State may classify persons
and objects for the purpose of legislation and pass laws for the
purpose of obtaining revenue or other objects. Every
differentiation is not a discrimination. But classification can
be sustained only if it is founded on pertinent and real
differences as distinguished from irrelevant and artificial ones.
The constitutional standard by which the sufficiency of the
differentia which form a valid basis for classification may be
measured has been repeatedly stated by the courts. If it rests
on a difference which bears a fair and just relation to the object
for which it is proposed, it is constitutional. To put it differently,
16the means must have nexus with the ends. Even so, a large
latitude is allowed to the State for classification upon a
reasonable basis and what is reasonable is a question of
practical details and a variety of factors which the Court will
be reluctant and perhaps ill­equipped to investigate. In this
imperfect world perfection even in grouping is an ambition
hardly ever accomplished. In this context, we have to
remember the relationship between the legislative and judicial
departments of Government in the determination of the
validity of classification. Of course, in the last analysis courts
possess the power to pronounce on the constitutionality of the
acts of the other branches whether a classification is based
upon substantial differences or is arbitrary, fanciful and
consequently illegal. At the same time, the question of
classification is primarily for legislative judgment, and
ordinarily does not become a judicial question. A power to
classify being extremely broad and based on diverse
considerations of executive pragmatism, the judicature cannot
rush in where even the legislature warily treads. All these
operational restraints on judicial power must weigh more
emphatically where the subject is taxation.”

It was observed in Subramanian Swamy (supra) that where
statutory provisions are clear and unambiguous, it cannot be read
down. It would not be possible to carry out directions of this Court as
number of Dy. S.P. Level Officers is not sufficient to make compliance
of the directions.
21. Concerning the exercise of powers under Article 142 of
Constitution of India, learned Attorney General has submitted that
such power could not have been exercised against the spirit of
statutory provisions and to nullify them and field reserved for the
legislature as there was no vacuum. He has referred to the following
decisions:
(a) In Supreme Court Bar Association v. Union of India, (1998) 4 SCC
409, this Court has observed as under:
17“47. …..It, however, needs to be remembered that the powers
conferred on the Court by Article 142 being curative in nature
cannot be construed as powers which authorise the Court to ignore
the substantive rights of a litigant while dealing with a cause
pending before it. This power cannot be used to “supplant”
substantive law applicable to the case or cause under consideration
of the Court. Article 142, even with the width of its amplitude,
cannot be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by
ignoring express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and
thereby to achieve something indirectly which cannot be achieved
directly. …..
48. …..Indeed, these constitutional powers cannot, in any way, be
controlled by any statutory provisions but at the same time these
powers are not meant to be exercised when their exercise may come
directly in conflict with what has been expressly provided for in a
statute dealing expressly with the subject.”
(b) In Prem Chand Garg v. Excise Commr., AIR 1963 SC 996, the
Court observed that it has no power to circumscribe fundamental
rights guaranteed under Article 32 of Constitution of India.
(c) In E.S.P. Rajaram v. Union of India, (2001) 2 SCC 186, the Court
observed that the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the
Constitution could not altogether disregard the substantive provisions
of a statute and pass orders concerning an issue, which can be settled
only through a mechanism prescribed in another statute.
(d) In A.R. Antulay v. R.S. Nayak, (1988) 2 SCC 602, it has been
observed that though the language of article 142 is comprehensive
and plenary, the directions given by the court should not be
inconsistent with, repugnant to or in violation of the specific
provisions of any statute.
18(e) In Bonkya v. State of Maharashtra, (1995) 6 SCC 447, the Court
has held that the Court exercises jurisdiction under Article 142 of the
Constitution intending to do justice between the parties, but not in
disregard of the relevant statutory provisions.
(f) In M.C. Mehta v. Kamal Nath, (2000) 6 SCC 213, this Court has
observed that Article 142, even with the width of its amplitude, cannot
be used to build a new edifice where none existed earlier, by ignoring
express statutory provisions dealing with a subject and thereby
achieve something indirectly which cannot be achieved directly.
(g) In State of Punjab v. Rajesh Syal, (2002) 8 SCC 158, the Court
held that even in exercising power under Article 142(1), it is more than
doubtful that an order can be passed contrary to law.
(h) In Textile Labour Association v. Official Liquidator, (2004) 9 SCC 741,
observation has been made that power under Article 142 is only a
residuary power, supplementary and complementary to the powers
expressly conferred on this Court by statutes, exercisable to do
complete justice between the parties wherever it is just and equitable
to do so. It is intended to prevent any obstruction to the stream of
justice.
(i) In Laxmidas Morarji v. Behrose Darab Madan, (2009) 10 SCC
425, it was observed that the Supreme Court would not pass any
19order under Article 142 of the Constitution which would amount to
supplanting substantive law applicable or ignoring express statutory
provisions dealing with the subject, at the same time these
constitutional powers cannot in any way, be controlled by any
statutory provisions.
(j) In Manish Goel v. Rohini Goel, (2010) 4 SCC 393, it was observed
that the courts are meant to enforce the rule of law and not to pass
the orders or directions which are contrary to what has been injected
by law. The power under Article 142 not to be exercised in a case
where there is no basis in law which can form an edifice for building
up a superstructure.
(k) In A.B. Bhaskara Rao v. CBI, (2011) 10 SCC 259, it was held that
the power under Article 142 is not restricted by statutory provisions.
It cannot be exercised based on sympathy and in conflict with the
statute.
(l) In State of Punjab v. Rafiq Masih, (2014) 8 SCC 883, this Court
held that Article 142 is supplementary and it cannot supplant the
substantive provisions. It is a power which gives preference to equity
over the law. The relevant portion is extracted hereunder:
“12. Article 142 of the Constitution of India is supplementary in
nature and cannot supplant the substantive provisions, though
they are not limited by the substantive provisions in the statute. It
is a power that gives preference to equity over law. It is a justice­
oriented approach as against the strict rigours of the law. The
20directions issued by the Court can normally be categorised into one,
in the nature of moulding of relief and the other, as the declaration
of law. “Declaration of law” as contemplated in Article 141 of the
Constitution: is the speech express or necessarily implied by the
highest court of the land…..This Court on the qui vive has expanded
the horizons of Article 142 of the Constitution by keeping it outside
the purview of Article 141 of the Constitution and by declaring it a
direction of the Court that changes its complexion with the
peculiarity in the facts and circumstances of the case.”
(emphasis supplied)
22. It is submitted that there was no legislative vacuum calling for
the exercise of power under Article 142 of the Constitution of India
and hence the reliance on Vishakha v. State of Rajasthan, (1997) 6
SCC 241 is misplaced. On the contrary, the matter was covered by
the statute; namely, Section 18 of the said Atrocities Act read with
Section 41 of Cr.PC.
23. We now propose to examine the law concerning field reserved for
the legislature and extant of judicial interference in the field reserved
for the legislature. The difference between the common law and
statute law has been brought out in the following passage in the book,
Salmond on Jurisprudence, 12th Edition; Sweet & Maxwell:
“In the strict sense, however, legislation is the laying down of legal
rules by a sovereign or subordinate legislator. Here we must
distinguish law­making by legislators from law­making by the
courts. Legislators can lay down rules purely for the future and
without reference to any actual dispute; the courts, in so far as they
create law, can do so only in application to the cases before them
and only in so far as is necessary for their solution. Judicial law­
making is incidental to the solving of legal disputes; legislative law­
making is the central function of the legislator.”
24. In various decisions, this Court has dealt with the scope of
judicial review and issuance of guidelines. The directions mentioned
21above touch the realm of policy. In Bachan Singh v. the State of
Punjab, (1980) 2 SCC 684, the Court has laid down and recognised the
judicial review thus:
“67. Behind the view that there is a presumption of
constitutionality of a statute and the onus to rebut the same lies on
those who challenge the legislation, is the rationale of judicial
restraint, a recognition of the limits of judicial review, a respect for
the boundaries of legislative and judicial functions, and the judicial
responsibility to guard the trespass from one side or the other. The
primary function of the courts is to interpret and apply the laws
according to the will of those who made them and not to transgress
into the legislative domain of policy­making. "The job of a Judge is
judging and not law­making." In Lord Devlin's words: "Judges are
the keepers of the law, and the keepers of these boundaries cannot,
also, be among outriders."
(emphasis supplied)
It has been observed that the Court should not transgress into
the legislative domain of policymaking.
25. In Asif Hameed & Ors. v. State of Jammu and Kashmir & Ors.,
1989 Supp. (2) SCC 364, this Court has observed that it is not for the
Court to pronounce policy. It cannot lay down what is wise or politic.
Self­restraint is the essence of the judicial oath. The Court observed:
"17. Before adverting to the controversy directly involved in these
appeals, we may have a fresh look on the inter se functioning of the
three organs of democracy under our Constitution. Although the
doctrine of separation of powers has not been recognised under the
Constitution in its absolute rigidity but the Constitution makers
have meticulously defined the functions of various organs of the
State. Legislature, executive and judiciary have to function within
their own spheres demarcated under the Constitution. No organ can
usurp the functions assigned to another. The Constitution trusts to
the judgment of these organs to function and exercise their
discretion by strictly following the procedure prescribed therein. The
functioning of democracy depends upon the strength and
independence of each of its organs. Legislature and executive, the
two facets of people's will, they have all the powers, including that of
finance. Judiciary has no power over sword or the purse;
nonetheless, it has power to ensure that the aforesaid two main
organs of State function within the constitutional limits. It is the
22sentinel of democracy. Judicial review is a powerful weapon to
restrain unconstitutional exercise of power by the legislature and
executive. The expanding horizon of judicial review has taken in its
fold the concept of social and economic justice. While exercise of
powers by the legislature and executive is subject to judicial
restraint, the only check on our own exercise of power is the self­
imposed discipline of judicial restraint.
18. Frankfurter, J. of the U.S. Supreme Court dissenting in the
controversial expatriation case of Trop v. Dulles, 356 US 96
observed as under:
"All power is, in Madison's phrase, "of an encroaching
nature." Judicial power is not immune against this human
weakness. It also must be on guard against encroaching
beyond its proper bounds, and not the less so since the only
restraint upon it is self­restraint...
Rigorous observance of the difference between limits of power
and wise exercise of power — between questions of authority
and questions of prudence — requires the most alert
appreciation of this decisive but subtle relationship of two
concepts that too easily coalesce. No less does it require a
disciplined will to adhere to the difference. It is not easy to
stand aloof and allow want of wisdom to prevail to disregard
one’s own strongly held view of what is wise in the conduct of
affairs. But it is not the business of this Court to pronounce
policy. It must observe a fastidious regard for limitations on its
own power, and this precludes the court’s giving effect to its
own notions of what is wise or politic. That self­restraint is of
the essence in the observance of the judicial oath, for the
Constitution has not authorized the judges to sit in judgment
on the wisdom of what Congress and the executive branch do."
(emphasis supplied)
The Court held that it could not affect its notions of what is wise
or politic. It is for the legislature to consider data and decide such
aspects. The law laid down in Asif Hameed v. State of Jammu and
Kashmir (supra) has been reiterated by this Court in S.C. Chandra v.
State of Jharkhand, (2007) 8 SCC 279.
2326. In Indian Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Workmen, Indian
Drugs & Pharmaceuticals Ltd., (2007) 1 SCC 408, the Court observed
thus:
“40. The courts must, therefore, exercise judicial restraint, and not
encroach into the executive or legislative domain. Orders for
creation of posts, appointment on these posts, regularisation, fixing
pay scales, continuation in service, promotions, etc. are all
executive or legislative functions, and it is highly improper for
Judges to step into this sphere, except in a rare and exceptional
case. The relevant case­law and philosophy of judicial restraint has
been laid down by the Madras High Court in great detail in Rama
Muthuramalingam v. Dy. Supdt. of Police, AIR 2005 Mad 1 and we
fully agree with the views expressed therein.”
27. In Divisional Manager, Aravali Golf Club v. Chander Hass, (2008)
1 SCC 683, this Court held as under:
“18. Judges must` exercise judicial restraint and must not
encroach into the executive or legislative domain, vide Indian Drugs
& Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Workmen (2007) 1 SCC 408 and S.C.
Chandra v. State of Jharkhand (2007) 8 SCC 279 (see concurring
judgment of M. Katju, J.).
19. Under our Constitution, the legislature, the executive and the
judiciary all have their own broad spheres of operation. Ordinarily,
it is not proper for any of these three organs of the State to
encroach upon the domain of another, otherwise the delicate
balance in the Constitution will be upset, and there will be a
reaction."
28. In Kuchchh Jal Sankat Nivaran Samili & Ors. v. State of Gujarat
& Anr., (2013) 12 SCC 226, it has been observed that Court should
not encroach upon the legislative domain. It cannot term a particular
policy as fairer than the other. The Court observed:
"12. We have given our most anxious consideration to the rival
submissions, and we find substance in the submission of Mr.
Divan. We are conscious of the fact that there is wide separation of
powers between the different limbs of the State and, therefore, it is
expected of this Court to exercise judicial restraint and not
encroach upon the executive or legislative domain. What the
24appellants in substance are asking this Court to do is to conduct a
comparative study and hold that the policy of distribution of water
is bad. We are afraid; we do not have the expertise or wisdom to
analyse the same. It entails intricate economic choices and though
this Court tends to believe that it is expert of experts, but this
principle has inherent limitation. True it is that the Court is entitled
to analyse the legal validity of the different means of distribution
but it cannot and will not term a particular policy as fairer than the
other. We are of the opinion that the matters affecting the policy
and requiring technical expertise be better left to the decision of
those who are entrusted and qualified to address the same. This
Court shall step in only when it finds that the policy is inconsistent
with the constitutional laws or is arbitrary or irrational.”
(emphasis supplied)
29. In Dr. Subhash Kashinath Mahajan v. State of Maharashtra,
(2018) 6 SCC 454, this Court held that no directions could be issued
which are directly in conflict with the statute.
30. In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, (1973) 4 SCC 225,
this Court has observed as under:
292. The learned Attorney­General said that every provision of the
Constitution is essential; otherwise, it would not have been put in
the Constitution. This is true. But this does not place every
provision of the Constitution in the same position. The true position
is that every provision of the Constitution can be amended provided
in the result the basic foundation and structure of the constitution
remains the same. The basic structure may be said to consist of the
following features:
(1) Supremacy of the Constitution;
(2) Republican and Democratic form of Government;
(3) Secular character of the Constitution;
(4) Separation of powers between the legislature, the executive
and the judiciary;
(5) Federal character of the Constitution.
31. In I.R. Coelho v. State of T.N., (2007) 2 SCC 1, the following
observations have been made:
“129. Further, the Court in Kesavananda case not only held that
Article 31­B is not controlled by Article 31­A but also specifically
upheld the Twenty­ninth Constitution Amendment whereby certain
Kerala Land Reform Acts were included in the Ninth Schedule after
25those Acts had been struck down by the Supreme Court in
Kunjukutty Sahib v. State of Kerala, (1972) 2 SCC 364. The only
logical basis for upholding the Twenty­ninth Amendment is that the
Court was of the opinion that the mechanism of Article 31­B, by
itself, is valid, though each time Parliament in exercise of its
constituent power added a law in the Ninth Schedule, such exercise
would have to be tested on the touchstone of the basic structure
test. [See Shelat & Grover, JJ., paras 607 & 608(7); Hegde &
Mukherjea, JJ., paras 738­43, 744(8); Ray, J., paras 1055­60,
1064; Jaganmohan Reddy, J., para 1212(4); Palekar, J., para
1333(3); Khanna, J., paras 1522, 1536, 1537(xv); Mathew, J., para
1782; Beg, J., paras 1857(6); Dwivedi, J., para 1994, 1995(4) and
Chandrachud, J., paras 2136­41 and 2142(10).]
130. As pointed out, it is a fallacy to regard that Article 31­B read
with the Ninth Schedule excludes judicial review in the matter of
violation of fundamental rights. The effect of Article 31­B is to
remove a fetter on the power of Parliament to pass a law in violation
of fundamental rights. On account of Article 31­B, cause of action
for violation of fundamental right is not available because the fetter
placed by Part III on legislative power is removed and is non­
existent. Non­availability of cause of action based on breach of
fundamental right cannot be regarded as exclusion or ouster of
judicial review. As a result of the operation of Article 31­B read with
the Ninth Schedule, occasion for exercise of judicial review does not
arise. But there is no question of exclusion or ouster of judicial
review. The two concepts are different."
32. In Bhim Singh v. Union of India, (2010) 5 SCC 538, it was held as
under:
“77. Another contention raised by the petitioners is that the
Scheme violates the principle of separation of powers under the
Constitution. The concept of separation of powers, even though
not found in any particular constitutional provision, is inherent in
the polity the Constitution has adopted. The aim of separation of
powers is to achieve the maximum extent of accountability of each
branch of the Government.
78. While understanding this concept, two aspects must be borne
in mind. One, that separation of powers is an essential feature of
the Constitution. Two that in modern governance, a strict
separation is neither possible, nor desirable. Nevertheless, till this
principle of accountability is preserved, there is no violation of
separation of powers. We arrive at the same conclusion when we
assess the position within the constitutional text. The Constitution
does not prohibit overlap of functions, but in fact, provides for
some overlap as a parliamentary democracy. But what it prohibits
is such exercise of function of the other branch which results in
wresting away of the regime of constitutional accountability.
26***
85. Again, in the Constitution Bench judgment in A.K. Roy v.
Union of India Chandrachud, C.J. speaking for the majority held at
p. 295, para 23 that: "our Constitution does not follow the
American pattern of a strict separation of powers."
86. This Court has previously held that the taking away of the
judicial function through legislation would be violative of
separation of powers. As Chandrachud, J. noted in Indira Nehru
Gandhi v. Raj Narain, 1975 Supp SCC 1: (SCC p. 261, para 689)
“689. … the exercise by the legislature of what is purely
and indubitably a judicial function is impossible to sustain in
the context even of our cooperative federalism which contains
no rigid distribution of powers but which provides a system
of salutary checks and balances.”
This is because such legislation upsets the balance between the
various organs of the State thus harming the system of
accountability in the Constitution.
87. Thus, the test for the violation of separation of powers must be
precisely this. A law would be violative of separation of powers not
if it results in some overlap of functions of different branches of
the State, but if it takes over an essential function of the other
branch leading to lapse in constitutional accountability. It is
through this test that we must analyse the present Scheme.”
33. In State of T.N. v. State of Kerala, (2014) 12 SCC 696, it was
observed as under:
“126. On deep reflection of the above discussion, in our opinion, the
constitutional principles in the context of Indian Constitution
relating to separation of powers between the legislature, executive
and judiciary may, in brief, be summarised thus:
126.1. Even without express provision of the separation of powers,
the doctrine of separation of powers is an entrenched principle in
the Constitution of India. The doctrine of separation of powers
informs the Indian constitutional structure and it is an essential
constituent of rule of law. In other words, the doctrine of separation
of power though not expressly engrafted in the Constitution, its
sweep, operation, and visibility are apparent from the scheme of
Indian Constitution. Constitution has made demarcation, without
drawing formal lines between the three organs—legislature,
executive and judiciary. In that sense, even in the absence of
express provision for separation of powers, the separation of powers
between the legislature, executive and judiciary is not different from
the Constitutions of the countries which contain express provision
for separation of powers.
27126.2. Independence of courts from the executive and legislature is
fundamental to the rule of law and one of the basic tenets of Indian
Constitution. Separation of judicial power is a significant
constitutional principle under the Constitution of India.
126.3. Separation of powers between three organs—the legislature,
executive and judiciary—is also nothing but a consequence of
principles of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of
India. Accordingly, breach of separation of judicial power may
amount to negation of equality under Article 14. Stated thus, a
legislation can be invalidated on the basis of breach of the
separation of powers since such breach is negation of equality
under Article 14 of the Constitution.
126.4. The superior judiciary (High Courts and Supreme Court) is
empowered by the Constitution to declare a law made by the
legislature (Parliament and State Legislatures) void if it is found to
have transgressed the constitutional limitations or if it infringed the
rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.
126.5. The doctrine of separation of powers applies to the final
judgments of the courts. The legislature cannot declare any decision
of a court of law to be void or of no effect. It can, however, pass an
amending Act to remedy the defects pointed out by a court of law or
on coming to know of it aliunde. In other words, a court’s decision
must always bind unless the conditions on which it is based are so
fundamentally altered that the decision could not have been given
in the altered circumstances.
126.6. If the legislature has the power over the subject­matter and
competence to make a validating law, it can at any time make such
a validating law and make it retrospective. The validity of a
validating law, therefore, depends upon whether the legislature
possesses the competence which it claims over the subject­matter
and whether in making the validation law it removes the defect
which the courts had found in the existing law.
126.7. The law enacted by the legislature may apparently seem to
be within its competence but yet in substance if it is shown as an
attempt to interfere with the judicial process, such law may be
invalidated being in breach of doctrine of separation of powers. In
such situation, the legal effect of the law on a judgment or a judicial
proceeding must be examined closely, having regard to legislative
prescription or direction. The questions to be asked are:
(i) Does the legislative prescription or legislative direction
interfere with the judicial functions?
(ii) Is the legislation targeted at the decided case or whether
impugned law requires its application to a case already finally
decided?
(iii) What are the terms of law; the issues with which it deals and
the nature of the judgment that has attained finality?
28If the answer to Questions (i) and (ii) is in the affirmative and the
consideration of aspects noted in Question (iii) sufficiently
establishes that the impugned law interferes with the judicial
functions, the Court may declare the law unconstitutional.”
34. The House of Lords in Stock v. Frank Jones (Tipton), 1978 (1)
WLR 231 with respect to interpretation of the legislative provisions has
observed thus:
“It is idle to debate whether, in so acting, the court is making law.
As has been cogently observed, it depends on what you mean by
“make” and “law” in this context. What is incontestible is that the
court is a mediating influence between the executive and the
legislature, on the one hand, and the citizen on the other.
Nevertheless, it is essential to the proper judicial function in the
constitution to bear in mind:
(1) modern legislation is a difficult and complicated process, in
which, even before a bill is introduced in a House of Parliament,
successive drafts are considered and their possible repercussions
on all envisageable situations are weighed by people bringing to
bear a very wide range of experience: the judge cannot match such
experience or envisage all such repercussions, either by training or
by specific forensic aid;
(2) the bill is liable to be modified in a Parliament dominated by a
House of Commons whose members are answerable to the citizens
who will be affected by the legislation: an English judge is not so
answerable;
(3) in a society living under the rule of law citizens are entitled to
regulate their conduct according to what a statute has said, rather
than by what it was meant to say or by what it would have
otherwise said if a newly considered situation had been envisaged;
(4) a stark contradistinction between the letter and the spirit of the
law may be very well in the sphere of ethics, but in the forensic
process St. John is a safer guide than St. Paul, the logos being the
informing spirit; and it should be left to peoples’ courts in
totalitarian regimes to stretch the law to meet the forensic situation
in response to a gut reaction;
(5) Parliament may well be prepared to tolerate some anomaly in
the interest of an overriding objective;
(6) what strikes the lawyer as an injustice may well have seemed to
the legislature as no more than the correction of a now unjustifiable
privilege or a particular misfortune necessarily or acceptably
29involved in the vindication of some supervening general social
benefit;
(7) the parliamentary draftsmen knows what objective the
legislative promoter wishes to attain, and he will normally and
desirably try to achieve that objective by using language of the
appropriate register in its natural, ordinary and primary sense to
reject such an approach on the grounds that it gives rise to an
anomaly is liable to encourage complication and anfractuosity in
drafting;
(8) Parliament is nowadays in continuous session so that an
unlooked­for and unsupportable injustice or anomaly can be readily
rectified by legislation: this is far preferable to judicial contortion of
the law to meet apparently hard cases with the result that ordinary
citizens and their advisers hardly know where they stand.
All this is not to advocate judicial supineness: it is merely
respectfully to commend a self­knowledge of judicial limitations,
both personal and constitution…..”
35. A lecture delivered by Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, former
Chief Justice of India, at the Constitution Day on 26.2.2016 in this
Court, has been relied upon in the context of judicial determination of
policy. Following observations have been relied upon:
"The proposition that "when there is no law the executive must
step­in and when the executive also does not act the judiciary
should do so" is an attractive invitations: but it is more attractive
than constitutionally sound. Executive power is of course
coextensive with legislative power. A field un­occupied by law is
open to the executive. But there is no warrant that by virtue of
those provisions the courts can come in and legislate. The
argument that the larger power of the court to decide and
pronounce upon the validity of law includes the power to frame
schemes and issue directions in the nature of legislation may
equally be open to question.
This is typically the converse case of Bills of attainder; Legislative
determination of disputes/rights has been held to be illegal and
impressible. Ameerunnisa, Ram Prasad Narayan Sahi and Indira
Gandhi are some of the telling cases. By the same logic and
converse reasoning, judicial legislation which is judicial
determination of policy and law is difficult to be justified
jurisprudentially. It is one of the basic constitutional principles
that just as courts are not constitutionally competent to legislate
under the guise of interpretation so also neither Parliament nor
State Legislatures can perform an essentially judicial function.
30None of the three constitutionally assigned spheres or orbits of
authority can encroach upon the other. This is the logical meaning
of the supremacy of the Constitution.
Lord Devlin's comment comes to mind; ‘The British have no more
wish to be governed by the judges than they wish to be judged by
their admirations’.
This is not to deny the need and the desirability of such measures.
The question is one of legitimacy and propriety, Robert Bork’s
profound statement comes to mind:
".. the desire to do justice whose nature seems obvious is
compelling, while the concept of constitutional process is abstract,
rather arid, and the abstinence it counsels unsatisfying. To give in
to temptation, this one time, solves an urgent human problem, and
a faint crack develops in the American foundation. A judge has
begun to rule where a legislator should". (THE TEMPTING OF
AMERICA)
Any support or justification for judicial legislation will have to be
premised on sound legal reasoning. It cannot be justified for the
reason that it produces welcome and desirable results. If that is
done, law will cease to be what justice Holmes named it, “the calling
of thinkers and becomes the province of emotions and sensitivities".
It then becomes a process of personal choice followed by
rationalisation. The major and minor premises do not lead to a
result; but the result produces major and minor premises. This is a
reversal of the process ­ virtually making concept of constitutional
adjudication stand on its head. It is to law what Robert Frost called
‘free verse,' "Tennis with the net down." Then naturally there are no
rules, only passions. Legal reasoning rooted in a concern for
legitimate process rather than desired results restricts judges to
their proper role in a constitutional democracy. That marks off the
line between judicial power and legislative power. Legislation,
contrary to some popular notions, is a very elaborate democratic
process. It takes much to distil the raw amorphous public opinion
into scalable legislative values through the multi­tiered filter of
parliamentary processes & procedures….."
36. In the light of the discussion mentioned above of legal principles,
we advert to directions issued in paragraph 83. Direction Nos. (iii) and
(iv) and consequential direction No. (v) are sought to be
reviewed/recalled. Directions contain the following aspects: ­
311.That arrest of a public servant can only be after approval of the
appointing authority.
2.The arrest of a non­public servant after approval by the Senior
Superintendent of Police (SSP).
3. The arrest may be in an appropriate case if considered necessary
for reasons to be recorded;
4.Reasons for arrest must be scrutinised by the Magistrate for
permitting further detention;
5.Preliminary enquiry to be conducted by the Dy. S.P. level officers
to find out whether the allegations make out a case and that the
allegations are not frivolous or motivated.
6. Any violation of the directions mentioned above will be
actionable by way of disciplinary action as well as contempt.
37. Before we dilate upon the aforesaid directions, it is necessary to
take note of certain aspects. It cannot be disputed that as the
members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have suffered
for long; the protective discrimination has been envisaged under
Article 15 of the Constitution of India and the provisions of the Act of
1989 to make them equals.
3238. All the offences under the Atrocities Act are cognizable. The
impugned directions put the riders on the right to arrest. An accused
cannot be arrested in atrocities cases without the concurrence of the
higher Authorities or appointing authority as the case may be. As per
the existing provisions, the appointing authority has no power to grant
or withhold sanction to arrest concerning a public servant.
39. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes Annual Report
2015­16, has recommended for prompt registration of FIRs thus:
"The Commission has noted with concern that instances of
procedural lapses are frequent while dealing atrocity cases by both
police and civil administration. There are delays in the judicial
process of the cases. The Commission, therefore, identified lacunae
commonly noticed during police investigation, as also
preventive/curable actions the civil administration can take. NCSC
recommends the correct and timely application of SC/ST (PoA)
Amendment Act, 2015 and Amendment Rules of 2016 as well as the
following for improvement:
8.6.1 Registration of FIRs ­ The Commission has observed that the
police often resort to preliminary investigation upon receiving a
complaint in writing before lodging the actual FIRs. As a result, the
SC victims have to resort to seeking directions from courts for
registration of FIRs u/s 156(3) of Cr.P.C. Hon’ble Supreme Court
has also on more than one occasion emphasized about registration
of FIR first. This Commission again reemphasizes that the State /
UT Governments should enforce prompt registration of FIRs.”
(emphasis supplied)
40. The learned Attorney General pointed out that the statistics
considered by the Court in the judgment under review indicate that 9
to 10 percent cases under the Act were found to be false. The
percentage of false cases concerning other general crimes such as
forgery is comparable, namely 11.51 percent and for kidnapping and
33abduction, it is 8.85 percent as per NCRB data for the year 2016. The
same can be taken care of by the Courts under Section 482, and in
case no prima facie case is made out, the Court can always consider
grant of anticipatory bail and power of quashing in appropriate cases.
For the low conviction rate, he submitted that same is the reflection of
the failure of the criminal justice system and not an abuse of law. The
witnesses seldom come to support down­trodden class, biased
mindset continues, and they are pressurised in several manners, and
the complainant also hardly muster the courage.
41. As to prevailing conditions in various areas of the country, we
are compelled to observe that SCs/STs are still making the struggle for
equality and for exercising civil rights in various areas of the country.
The members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are still
discriminated against in various parts of the country. In spite of
reservation, the fruits of development have not reached to them, by
and large, they remain unequal and vulnerable section of the society.
The classes of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes have been
suffering ignominy and abuse, and they have been outcast socially for
the centuries. The efforts for their upliftment should have been
percolated down to eradicate their sufferings.
42. Though, Article 17 of the Constitution prohibits untouchability,
whether untouchability has vanished? We have to find the answer to
34all these pertinent questions in the present prevailing social scenario
in different parts of the country. The clear answer is that
untouchability though intended to be abolished, has not vanished in
the last 70 years. We are still experimenting with ‘tryst with destiny.'
The plight of untouchables is that they are still denied various civil
rights; the condition is worse in the villages, remote areas where fruits
of development have not percolated down. They cannot enjoy equal
civil rights. So far, we have not been able to provide the modern
methods of scavenging to Harijans due to lack of resources and proper
planning and apathy. Whether he can shake hand with a person of
higher class on equal footing? Whether we have been able to reach
that level of psyche and human dignity and able to remove
discrimination based upon caste? Whether false guise of cleanliness
can rescue the situation, how such condition prevails and have not
vanished, are we not responsible? The answer can only be found by
soul searching. However, one thing is sure that we have not been able
to eradicate untouchability in a real sense as envisaged and we have
not been able to provide down­trodden class the fundamental civil
rights and amenities, frugal comforts of life which make life worth
living. More so, for Tribals who are at some places still kept in
isolation as we have not been able to provide them even basic
amenities, education and frugal comforts of life in spite of spending a
considerable amount for the protection, how long this would continue.
35Whether they have to remain in the status quo and to entertain
civilized society? Whether under the guise of protection of the culture,
they are deprived of fruits of development, and they face a violation of
traditional rights?
43. In Khadak Singh vs. State of Himachal Pradesh, AIR 1963 SC
1295, this Court has observed that the right to life is not merely an
animal's existence. Under Article 21, the right to life includes the right
to live with dignity. Basic human dignity implies that all the persons
are treated as equal human in all respects and not treated as an
untouchable, downtrodden, and object for exploitation. It also implies
that they are not meant to be born for serving the elite class based
upon the caste. The caste discrimination had been deep­rooted, so the
consistent effort is on to remove it, but still, we have to achieve the
real goal. No doubt we have succeeded partially due to individual and
collective efforts.
44. The enjoyment of quality life by the people is the essence of
guaranteed right under Article 21 of the Constitution, as observed in
Hinch Lal Tiwari v. Kamla Devi, (2001) 6 SCC 496. Right to live with
human dignity is included in the right to life as observed in Francis
Coralie Mullin v. Union Territory Delhi, Administrator, AIR 1981 SC 746,
Olga Tellis v. Bombay Corporation, AIR 1986 SC 180. Gender injustice,
pollution, environmental degradation, malnutrition, social ostracism of
36Dalits are instances of human rights violations as observed by this
Court in People’s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India, (2005) 2
SCC 436:
"34. The question can also be examined from another angle. The
knowledge or experience of a police officer of human rights
violation represents only one facet of human rights violation and
its protection, namely, arising out of crime. Human rights
violations are of various forms which besides police brutality are
— gender injustice, pollution, environmental degradation,
malnutrition, social ostracism of Dalits, etc. A police officer can
claim to have experience of only one facet. That is not the
requirement of the section." (emphasis supplied)
45. There is right to live with dignity and also right to die with
dignity. For violation of human rights under Article 21 grant of
compensation is one of the concomitants which has found statutory
expression in the provisions of compensation, to be paid in case an
offence is committed under the provisions of the Act of 1989. A good
reputation is an element of personal security and is protected by the
Constitution equally with the right to the enjoyment of life, liberty, and
property. Therefore, it has been held to be an essential element of the
right to life of a citizen under Article 21 as observed by this Court in
Umesh Kumar v. State of Andhra Pradesh, (2013) 10 SCC 591, Kishore
Samrite v. State of Uttar Pradesh, (2013) 2 SCC 398 and Subramanian
Swamy v. Union of India, (2016) 7 SCC 221. The provisions of the Act
of 1989 are, in essence, concomitants covering various facets of Article
21 of the Constitution of India.
3746. They do labour, bonded or forced, in agricultural fields, which is
not abrogated in spite of efforts. In certain areas, women are not
treated with dignity and honour and are sexually abused in various
forms. We see sewer workers dying in due to poisonous gases in
chambers. They are like death traps. We have not been able to
provide the masks and oxygen cylinders for entering in sewer
chambers, we cannot leave them to die like this and avoid tortious
liability concerned with officials/machinery, and they are still
discriminated within the society in the matter of enjoying their civil
rights and cannot live with human dignity.
47. The Constitution of India provides equality before the law under
the provisions contained in Article 14. Article 15(4) of the Constitution
carves out an exception for making any special provision for the
advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of
citizens or SCs. and STs. Further protection is conferred under Article
15(5) concerning their admission to educational institutions, including
private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the
State, other than the minority educational institutions. Historically
disadvantageous groups must be given special protection and help so
that they can be uplifted from their poverty and low social status as
observed in Kailas & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, 2011 (1) SCC 793.
The legislature has to attempt such incumbents be protected under
38Article 15(4), to deal with them with more rigorous provisions as
compared to provisions of general law available to the others would
create inequality which is not permissible/envisaged constitutionally.
It would be an action to negate mandatory constitutional provisions
not supported by the constitutional scheme; rather, it would be
against the mandated constitutional protection. It is not open to the
legislature to put members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled
Tribes in a disadvantageous position vis­à­vis others and in particular
to so­called upper castes/general category. Thus, they cannot be
discriminated against more so when we have a peep into the
background perspective. What legislature cannot do legitimately,
cannot be done by the interpretative process by the courts.
48. The particular law, i.e., Act of 1989, has been enacted and has
also been amended in 2016 to make its provisions more effective.
Special prosecutors are to be provided for speedy trial of cases. The
incentives are also provided for rehabilitation of victims, protection of
witnesses and matters connected therewith.
49. There is no presumption that the members of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes may misuse the provisions of law as a
class and it is not resorted to by the members of the upper Castes or
the members of the elite class. For lodging a false report, it cannot be
said that the caste of a person is the cause. It is due to the human
39failing and not due to the caste factor. Caste is not attributable to
such an act. On the other hand, members of the Scheduled Castes
and Scheduled Tribes due to backwardness hardly muster the courage
to lodge even a first information report, much less, a false one. In case
it is found to be false/unsubstantiated, it may be due to the faulty
investigation or for other various reasons including human failings
irrespective of caste factor. There may be certain cases which may be
false that can be a ground for interference by the Court, but the law
cannot be changed due to such misuse. In such a situation, it can be
taken care in proceeding under section 482 of the Cr.PC.
50. The data of National Crime Records Bureau, Ministry of Home
Affairs, has been pointed out on behalf of Union of India which
indicates that more than 47,000 cases were registered in the year
2016 under the Act of 1989. The number is alarming, and it cannot be
said that it is due to the outcome of the misuse of the provisions of the
Act.
51. As a matter of fact, members of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes have suffered for long, hence, if we cannot provide
them protective discrimination beneficial to them, we cannot place
them at all at a disadvantageous position that may be causing injury
to them by widening inequality and against the very spirit of our
40Constitution. It would be against the basic human dignity to treat all
of them as a liar or as a crook person and cannot look at every
complaint by such complainant with a doubt. Eyewitnesses do not
come up to speak in their favour. They hardly muster the courage to
speak against upper caste, that is why provisions have been made by
way of amendment for the protection of witnesses and rehabilitation of
victims. All humans are equal including in their frailings. To treat
SCs. and STs. as persons who are prone to lodge false reports under
the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Act for
taking revenge or otherwise as monetary benefits made available to
them in the case of their being subjected to such offence, would be
against fundamental human equality. It cannot be presumed that a
person of such class would inflict injury upon himself and would lodge
a false report only to secure monetary benefits or to take revenge. If
presumed so, it would mean adding insult to injury, merely by the fact
that person may misuse provisions cannot be a ground to treat class
with doubt. It is due to human failings, not due to the caste factor.
The monetary benefits are provided in the cases of an acid attack,
sexual harassment of SC/ST women, rape, murder, etc. In such cases,
FIR is required to be registered promptly.
4152. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that the caste system still
prevails in the country and people remain in slums, more particularly,
under skyscrapers, and they serve the inhabitants of such buildings.
53. To treat such incumbents with a rider that a report lodged by an
SCs/STs category, would be registered only after a preliminary
investigation by Dy. S.P., whereas under Cr.PC a complaint lodged
relating to cognizable offence has to be registered forthwith. It would
mean a report by upper­caste has to be registered immediately and
arrest can be made forthwith, whereas, in case of an offence under the
Act of 1989, it would be conditioned one. It would be opposed to the
protective discrimination meted out to the members of the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes as envisaged under the Constitution in
Articles 15, 17 and 21 and would tantamount to treating them as
unequal, somewhat supportive action as per the mandate of
Constitution is required to make them equals. It does not prima facie
appear permissible to look them down in any manner. It would also be
contrary to the procedure prescribed under the Cr.PC and contrary to
the law laid down by this Court in Lalita Kumari (supra).
54. The guidelines in (iii) and (iv) appear to have been issued in view
of the provisions contained in Section 18 of the Act of 1989; whereas
adequate safeguards have been provided by a purposive interpretation
by this Court in the case of State of M.P. v. R.K. Balothia, (1995) 3 SCC
42221. The consistent view of this Court that if prima facie case has not
been made out attracting the provisions of SC/ST Act of 1989, in that
case, the bar created under section 18 on the grant of anticipatory bail
is not attracted. Thus, misuse of the provisions of the Act is intended
to be taken care of by the decision above. In Kartar Singh (supra), a
Constitution Bench of this Court has laid down that taking away the
said right of anticipatory bail would not amount to a violation of
Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Thus, prima facie it appears
that in the case of misuse of provisions, adequate safeguards are
provided in the decision mentioned above.
55. That apart directions (iii) and (iv) issued may delay the
investigation of cases. As per the amendment made in the Rules in the
year 2016, a charge sheet has to be filed to enable timely
commencement of the prosecution. The directions issued are likely to
delay the timely scheme framed under the Act/Rules.
In re: sanction of the appointing authority :
56. Concerning public servants, the provisions contained in Section
197, Cr.PC provide protection by prohibiting cognizance of the offence
without the sanction of the appointing authority and the provision
cannot be applied at the stage of the arrest. That would run against
the spirit of Section 197, Cr.PC. Section 41, Cr.PC authorises every
police officer to carry out an arrest in case of a cognizable offence and
43the very definition of a cognizable offence in terms of Section 2(c) of
Cr.PC is one for which police officer may arrest without warrant.
57. In case any person apprehends that he may be arrested,
harassed and implicated falsely, he can approach the High Court for
quashing the FIR under Section 482 as observed in State of Orissa v.
Debendra Nath Padhi, (2005) 1 SCC 568.
58. While issuing guidelines mentioned above approval of appointing
authority has been made imperative for the arrest of a public servant
under the provisions of the Act in case, he is an accused of having
committed an offence under the Act of 1989. Permission of the
appointing authority to arrest a public servant is not at all statutorily
envisaged; it is encroaching on a field which is reserved for the
legislature. The direction amounts to a mandate having legislative
colour which is a field not earmarked for the Courts.
59. The direction is discriminatory and would cause several legal
complications. On what basis the appointing authority would grant
permission to arrest a public servant? When the investigation is not
complete, how it can determine whether public servant is to be
arrested or not? Whether it would be appropriate for appointing
authority to look into case diary in a case where its sanction for
prosecution may not be required in an offence which has not
44happened in the discharge of official duty. Approaching appointing
authority for approval of arrest of a public servant in every case under
the Act of 1989 is likely to consume sufficient time. The appointing
authority is not supposed to know the ground realities of the offence
that has been committed, and arrest sometimes becomes necessary
forthwith to ensure further progress of the investigation itself. Often
the investigation cannot be completed without the arrest. There may
not be any material before the appointing authority for deciding the
question of approval. To decide whether a public servant should be
arrested or not is not a function of appointing authority, it is wholly
extra­statutory. In case appointing authority holds that a public
servant is not to be arrested and declines approval, what would
happen, as there is no provision for grant of anticipatory bail. It
would tantamount to take away functions of Court. To decide whether
an accused is entitled to bail under Section 438 in case no prima facie
case is made out or under Section 439 is the function of the Court.
The direction of appointing authority not to arrest may create conflict
with the provisions of Act of 1989 and is without statutory basis.
60. By the guidelines issued, the anomalous situation may crop up
in several cases. In case the appointing authority forms a view that as
there is no prima facie case the incumbent is not to be arrested,
several complications may arise. For the arrest of an offender, maybe a
45public servant, it is not the provision of the general law of Cr.PC that
permission of the appointing authority is necessary. No such statutory
protection provided to a public servant in the matter of arrest under
the IPC and the Cr.PC as such it would be discriminatory to impose
such rider in the cases under the Act of 1989. Only in the case of
discharge of official duties, some offence appears to have been
committed, in that case, sanction to prosecute may be required and
not otherwise. In case the act is outside the purview of the official
discharge of duty, no such sanction is required.
61. The appointing authority cannot sit over an FIR in case of
cognizable, non­bailable offense and investigation made by the Police
Officer; this function cannot be conferred upon the appointing
authority as it is not envisaged either in the Cr.P.C. or the Act of 1989.
Thus, this rider cannot be imposed in respect of the cases under the
Act of 1989, may be that provisions of the Act are sometimes misused,
exercise of power of approval of arrest by appointing authority is
wholly impermissible, impractical besides it encroaches upon the field
reserved for the legislature and is repugnant to the provisions of
general law as no such rider is envisaged under the general law.
62. Assuming it is permissible to obtain the permission of appointing
authority to arrest accused, would be further worsening the position of
46the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. If they
are not to be given special protection, they are not to be further put in
a disadvantageous position. The implementation of the condition may
discourage and desist them even to approach the Police and would
cast a shadow of doubt on all members of the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes which cannot be said to be constitutionally
envisaged. Other castes can misuse the provisions of law; also, it
cannot be said that misuse of law takes place by the provisions of Act
of 1989. In case the direction is permitted to prevail, days are not far
away when writ petition may have to be filed to direct the appointing
authority to consider whether accused can be arrested or not and as
to the reasons recorded by the appointing authority to permit or deny
the arrest. It is not the function of the appointing authority to
intermeddle with a criminal investigation. If at the threshold, approval
of appointing authority is made necessary for arrest, the very purpose
of the Act is likely to be frustrated. Various complications may arise.
Investigation cannot be completed within the specified time, nor trial
can be completed as envisaged. Act of 1989 delay would be adding to
the further plight of the downtrodden class.
In ref: approval of arrest by the SSP in the case of a non­public
servant:
63. Inter alia for the reasons as mentioned earlier, we are of the
considered opinion that requiring the approval of SSP before an arrest
47is not warranted in such a case as that would be discriminatory and
against the protective discrimination envisaged under the Act. Apart
from that, no such guidelines can prevail, which are legislative. When
there is no provision for anticipatory bail, obviously arrest has to be
made. Without doubting bona fides of any officer, it cannot be left at
the sweet discretion of the incumbent howsoever high. The approval
would mean that it can also be ordered that the person is not to be
arrested then how the investigation can be completed when the arrest
of an incumbent, is necessary, is not understandable. For an arrest of
accused such a condition of approval of SSP could not have been
made a sine qua non, it may delay the matter in the cases under the
Act of 1989.
Requiring the Magistrate to scrutinise the reasons for permitting
further detention:
64. As per guidelines issued by this Court, the public servant can be
arrested after approval by appointing authority and that of a non­
public servant after the approval of SSP. The reasons so recorded have
to be considered by the Magistrate for permitting further detention. In
case of approval has not been granted, this exercise has not been
undertaken. When the offence is registered under the Act of 1989, the
law should take its course no additional fetter sare called for on arrest
whether in case of a public servant or non­public servant. Even
otherwise, as we have not approved the approval of arrest by
48appointing authority/S.S.P., the direction to record reasons and
scrutiny by Magistrate consequently stands nullified.
65. The direction has also been issued that the Dy. S.P. should
conduct a preliminary inquiry to find out whether allegations make
out a case under the Atrocities Act, and that the allegations are not
frivolous or motivated. In case a cognisable offence is made out, the
FIR has to be outrightly registered, and no preliminary inquiry has to
be made as held in Lalita Kumari (supra) by a Constitution Bench.
There is no such provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure for
preliminary inquiry or under the SC/ST Act, as such direction is
impermissible. Moreover, it is ordered to be conducted by the person
of the rank of Dy. S.P. The number of Dy. S.P. as per stand of Union of
India required for such an exercise of preliminary inquiry is not
available. The direction would mean that even if a complaint made out
a cognizable offence, an FIR would not be registered until the
preliminary inquiry is held. In case a preliminary inquiry concludes
that allegations are false or motivated, FIR is not to be registered in
such a case how a final report has to be filed in the Court. The
direction (iv) cannot survive for the other reasons as it puts the
members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a
disadvantageous position in the matter of procedure vis­a­vis to the
complaints lodged by members of upper caste, for later no such
49preliminary investigation is necessary, in that view of matter it should
not be necessary to hold preliminary inquiry for registering an offence
under the Atrocities Act of 1989.
66. The creation of a casteless society is the ultimate aim. We
conclude with a pious hope that a day would come, as expected by the
framers of the Constitution, when we do not require any such
legislation like Act of 1989, and there is no need to provide for any
reservation to SCs/STs/OBCs, and only one class of human exist
equal in all respects and no caste system or class of SCs/STs or OBCs
exist, all citizens are emancipated and become equal as per
Constitutional goal.
67. We do not doubt that directions encroach upon the field reserved
for the legislature and against the concept of protective discrimination
in favour of down­trodden classes under Article 15(4) of the
Constitution and also impermissible within the parameters laid down
by this Court for exercise of powers under Article 142 of Constitution
of India. Resultantly, we are of the considered opinion that direction
Nos.(iii) and (iv) issued by this Court deserve to be and are hereby
recalled and consequently we hold that direction No. (v), also vanishes.
The review petitions are allowed to the extent mentioned above.
5068. All the pending applications regarding intervention etc. stand
disposed of.
