JAGADISH @ JAGANNATH .. APPELLANT(S)
vs.
STATE OF KARNATAKA .. RESPONDENT(S)
O R D E R
Leave granted.
This appeal is directed against the judgment and
order dated 20th August, 2008, passed by the Karnataka High
Court in Criminal Revision Petition No. 70 of 2007
disposing of the same on the ground that the courts below
had concurrently found that the charges had been proved
against the appellant herein beyond reasonable doubt.
As would appear from the impugned judgment, there was
a fight between the accused persons and the prosecution
witnesses in which some injury was caused to Vijayendra –
P.W. 1, Ramesha -P.W. 2 and Nagaraju – P.W. 3. Ultimately,
charge sheet was submitted under Sections 323, 324, 326,
506 read with Section 34 IPC and based on the evidence of
P.Ws.1 to 3 who were the injured witnesses, and the
doctor's evidence, the trial court convicted the appellantsCrl .A. No. of 2010 @ SLP(Crl.) 1738/2009
2
for the offence punishable under Sections 326 and 506 of
the Indian Penal Code [IPC]. On conviction, the appellant
No. 1 was sentenced to two years' rigorous imprisonment
under Section 326 IPC and one year's imprisonment under
Section 506 IPC. Against the said judgment an appeal was
preferred and the Appellate Court modified the judgment by
confirming the conviction of the accused Nos. 1 and 2, but
released accused No. 3 under the Probation of Offenders
Act, while acquitting the fourth accused.
The matter was ultimately carried in revision to the
High Court which confirmed the judgment of the learned
Sessions Judge at Mandya. Aggrieved thereby, this Special
Leave Petition was filed by the accused Nos. 1 and 3.
Before we proceed further, let it be recorded that
vide order dated 20th January, 2010, of this Court, the
Special Leave Petition of the petitioner No. 2 was
dismissed. Thus the present appeal arises out of the
Special Leave Petition and is confined to the accused No. 1
only.
From the nature of injuries disclosed in the evidence
adduced and the evidence of the Doctor who treated P.W. 1,
it seems that two of the injuries, namely, the breaking of
three ribs and a tooth, were found to be grievous by the
said doctor.
Considering the fact that the incident took placeCrl .A. No. of 2010 @ SLP(Crl.) 1738/2009
3
about ten years ago on 30th October, 2000, and the injuries
are also not of any grievous nature and particularly, in the
absence of any weapon as such and in the result and since
the appellant has already undergone one year's
imprisonment, out of the sentence of two years awarded to
him, we are inclined to reduce the sentence to the period
already undergone.
Accordingly, the appeal succeeds. The appellant is
sentenced to the period of imprisonment already undergone.
He be released forthwith, if not required in any other
case.
