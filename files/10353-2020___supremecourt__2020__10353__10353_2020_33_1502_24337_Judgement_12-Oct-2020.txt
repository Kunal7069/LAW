Versus
THE STATE OF PUNJAB …RESPONDENT
J U D G M E N T
R.F. Nariman, J.
1.Leave granted.
2.In an F.I.R dated 18.11.2018, involving Sections 302, 307, 452, 427,
341, 34 of the Indian Penal Code read with Section 25 of the Arms Act,
1959, Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and
Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, it was
stated as follows:
“I am a resident of above address and doing the business
of furniture at Nehru Complex, Amritsar. I do my religious
services in the Nirankari Bhawan at Rajasansi every
Sunday. Today, i.e, on 18.11.2018, Satsang was going on
at Satsang Bhawan, where about 200 Satsangis were
present. At about 11.30 a.m., I along with my companion
Gagandeep Singh son of Balwinder Singh, resident of
1Gumtala, was doing the duty of a Security Guard on the
main gate, when two young boys came there on a Pulsar
Motor Cycle without number of Black shade. Out of them,
one had worn Jean and Jacket and was having turban on
his head and he has muffled his face with a cloth of check.
He went inside and the other young boy, who was wearing
Kurta, Pyjama and Jacket and had muffled his face with a
handkerchief, took out a Pistol from the fold of his Pyjama
and made us to stand together near the Bathroom. The
young boy who had gone inside the Satsang Hall threw a
Hand Grenade on the stage with his right hand. An
explosion took place and the above-said young boy took
out a Pistol and ran towards the gate. Both the young men
ran towards Village Adliwal on their Pulsar Motor Cycle.
Due to Grenade explosion, about 22 persons from the
Sangat sustained serious injuries. The other persons
arranged conveyance and carried the injured to IVY
Hospital, Amritsar and Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar,
where Sukhdev Kumar son of Kans Raj, resident of Kohali,
now resident of Mirankot, aged about 45 years, Kuldeep
Singh son of Joginder Singh, resident of Bagga and
Sandeep Singh son of Amarjit Singh, resident of Ward No.
7, Rajasansi died in IVY Hospital, Amritsar. The above
young men by throwing a Hand Grenade on the Sangat,
have injured 22 persons seriously, out of which three
persons have died. Deterrent action be taken against the
above-mentioned accused. I have heard my statement. It is
correct.”
3.Pursuant to this F.I.R, the Punjab State Police apprehended the
Appellant, one Bikramjit Singh, aged 26 years, on 22.11.2018, on
which date he was remanded to custody by the learned Sub-Divisional
Magistrate. After 90 days in custody, which expired on 21.02.2019, an
application for default bail was made to the Sub-Divisional Judicial
Magistrate, Ajnala. This application was dismissed on 25.02.2019 on
2the ground that the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate had, by
an order dated 13.02.2019, already extended time from 90 days to
180 days under Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
(hereinafter referred to as “the Code”) as amended by the Unlawful
Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (hereinafter referred to as “UAPA”) –
See Section 43-D(2). However, this Order was challenged by way of a
revision petition by the Appellant and his co-accused, which revision
succeeded by an order dated 25.03.2019, by which the learned
Additional Sessions Judge being the Special Court set up under the
National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (hereinafter referred to as the
“NIA Act”) held as follows:
“6. After hearing the Ld Counsel for revision petitioner and
Ld PP for State, I am of the view that since Ld PP has not
controverted the proposition of law, wherein it is provided
that Ilaqa Magistrate has no jurisdiction to entertain any
application for extension the period of investigation or
granting bail u/s 167 (2) Cr.P.C in default of presentation of
Challan u/s 45 D (2) Unlawful Activities (Prevention Act
1967) and in view of the Notification supra passed by
Government of Punjab, to deal with the cases of unlawful
activities act, court of session or court of Additional Session
Judge, in every district has been designated to try the said
cases, so the application for seeking extension of time for
filing challan was not maintainable before Ilaqa magistrate.
7. Therefore, in view of the said notification as well as the
case laws referred by the Ld Counsel for revision petitioner,
only this court being special designated court was
competent to pass an order on any application moved u/s
45(D) (2) Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967. It
means, Ilaqa Magistrate was not competent to pass any
order on any such application. In case the same has been
3filed and passed i.e. without its jurisdiction. So because of
the said reason order passed by Ilaqa magistrate is not
sustainable in the eyes of law and the same is liable to be
set aside by way of acceptance of this revision petition.
Accordingly this revision is allowed and order of Ilaqa
magistrate dated 13.02.2019 is set aside. Trial court record
along with copy of this order be sent back to the Trial Court
and file of this court be consigned to record room.”
4.One day later, on 26.03.2019, a charge sheet was filed before the
learned Special Judge after police investigation, in which Sections
302, 307, 452, 427, 341, 34 of the Indian Penal Code read with
Section 25 of the Arms Act, 1959, Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 of the Explosive
Substances Act, 1908 and Sections 13, 16, 18, 18-B and 20 of the
Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 were invoked for offences
that were committed pursuant to investigation of the FIR lodged on
18.11.2018. Meanwhile, a revision petition that was filed against the
order dated 25.02.2019, was dismissed by the Special Judge on
11.04.2019 who, after noticing the order dated 25.03.2019 allowing
the revision petition against the order dated 13.02.2019 of the Judicial
Magistrate, yet refused to grant default bail as follows:
“10. No doubt, vide gazette notification issued by
Government of Punjab on 10.06.2014, the Session Judge
and first Additional Session Judge at each District Head
Quarters in the State are designated as special court for
the trial of offences of unlawful activities act. However, as
per the local arrangement, all the cases pertaining to
unlawful activities act are dealt in this court. So, being a
special court, this court is competent to directly receive the
challan or police report under section 173 Cr PC. Since the
challan has already been presented and in the judgement
4titled as Abdul Aziz PV and Other vs National Investigation
Agency 2015
(1) RCR (Criminal) 239, it has been held that merely
because certain facets of the matter called for further
investigation, it does not deem such report anything other
than a final report, revisionist are not entitled to statutory
bail under section 167 (2) Cr PC.
xxx xxx xxx
12. Since Challan has already been presented, so revision
petitioner have lost their right for bail by way of default
under section 167 (2) Cr PC. Therefore there is no reason
to interfere in the order of Ilaqa Magistrate passed under
section 167 (2) Cr PC so this revision petition fails and is
dismissed. Consign file to the record room.”
5.On the same day i.e. 11.04.2019, an application for default bail dated
08.04.2019 was also dismissed. By the impugned judgment dated
30.10.2019, the High Court, after setting out Section 167 of the Code
of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and some of the provisions of the UAPA
and NIA Act, then arrived at the following conclusion:
“A joint interpretation of Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. read with
Section 43 (d) UAP Act, Section 6, 13 & 22 of NIA Act
would show that in case the investigation is being carried
out by the State police, the Magistrate will have power
under Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C. read with Section 43 (a) of
UAP Act to extend the period of investigation upto 180
days and then, commit the case to the Court of Sessions
as per provisions of Section 209 Cr.P.C., whereas in case
the investigation is conducted by the agency under the NIA
Act, the power shall be exercised by the Special Court and
challan will be presented by the agency before the Special
Court.
xxx xxx xxx
It is not case of the petitioner that the investigation was
conducted by the agency under Section 6 of the NIA Act
and till committal of the case to the Court of Sessions, as
5per Section 22 (3) of NIA Act, it cannot be said that the
Magistrate has no power and therefore, the order dated
25.03.2019 suffers from illegal infirmity.
The arguments raised by learned senior counsel for the
petitioner that the petitioner is entitled to default bail under
Section 167 (2) Cr.P.C., in view of judgment of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in Sanjay Dutt's case (supra), is not
available, once the challan was presented by the
prosecution on 25.03.2019, as the application was filed by
the petitioner on the next day i.e. 26.03.2019
The Judge, Exclusive Court has recorded a well reasoned
finding that mere fact that sanction has not been granted
so far, is no ground to grant concession of bail, as it is
rightly held that besides the offence committed under the
UAP Act, the accused is also facing the trial for committing
the offence under Sections 302, 307, 452, 341, 427, 34
IPC read with Section 25/54/59 of Arms Act and Sections 3,
4, 5, & 6 of Explosive Act, for which no sanction is required
to prosecute the petitioner.
For the reasons recorded above and in view of judgment of
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur vs.
State of Maharashtra, 1994 (3) RCR (Crl.) 156, finding no
merit in the present petition, the same is dismissed.”
6.Shri Colin Gonsalves, learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of
the Appellant, referred to both the enactments as aforesaid in copious
detail and stressed the fact that once the Special Court had been set
up as an exclusive Court to try all offences under the UAPA, such
offences being scheduled offences relatable to the NIA Act, it was the
Special Court alone which had exclusive jurisdiction to extend the
period of 90 days to 180 days under Section 43-D (2)(b) of the UAPA.
This being the case, on an application having been made prior to the
filing of the charge sheet for default bail, his contention was that the
6indefeasible right to default bail arose immediately after 21.02.2019,
when the 90 day period was over. An order that is passed without
jurisdiction by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate dated
13.02.2019, had been corrected by the learned Additional Sessions
Judge/Special Court vide the order dated 25.03.2019, as a result of
which his right to default bail sprung into action before filing of the
charge sheet dated 26.03.2019. He, therefore, assailed the High
Court judgment on both counts – Firstly, that the exclusive jurisdiction
to extend time vested only in the Special Court and not in the Ilaqa
Magistrate, despite the fact that it was the State Police Agency that
investigated these offences. Secondly, he also argued, relying upon a
number of judgments, that the Appellant’s right to default bail was not
extinguished by the filing of the charge sheet dated 26.03.2019, as
was incorrectly held by the High Court.
7.Smt. Jaspreet Gogia, learned Advocate who appeared on behalf of the
State of Punjab, also took us through the provisions of both the
aforesaid enactments. She stressed in particular Section 10 of the NIA
Act, stating that nothing in the said Act would affect the powers of the
State Government to investigate and prosecute any scheduled
offence. She also stressed the fact that the entire investigation was
done only by the State Police and not by the National Investigation
Agency. This being the case, she argued that the Ilaqa Magistrate had
7jurisdiction to extend time, and having so extended time on
13.02.2019, any application for default bail after the 90 day period was
over i.e. after 21.02.2019 had necessarily to be dismissed. She also
argued that the first application for default bail which was filed on or
before 25.03.2019, had spent its force, having been dismissed, and
that the application dated 08.04.2019 filed for default bail was clearly
after 26.03.2019, when the charge sheet was filed and, therefore, was
correctly dismissed by the order of the learned Special Judge dated
11.04.2019.
8.Having heard learned counsel for the parties, it is important at this
stage to set out all the relevant provisions of the three enactments that
we are directly concerned with – the Code, UAPA and NIA Act.
9.It is important to note that the expression “Court” is not defined by the
Code. On the other hand, Section 6 of the Code refers to classes of
Criminal Courts as follows:
“6. Classes of Criminal Courts.
Besides the High Courts and the Courts constituted under
any law, other than this Code, there shall be, in every
State, the following classes of Criminal Courts, namely:
(i) Courts of Session;
(ii) Judicial Magistrates of the first class and, in any
metropolitan area, Metropolitan Magistrates;
(iii) Judicial Magistrates of the second class; and
(iv) Executive Magistrates.”
8The Court of Sessions is then referred to as a Court that is established
by the State Government under Section 9(1) of the Code for every
Sessions Division.
10.Section 26 of the Code refers to Courts by which offences are triable.
We are concerned directly with Section 26(b) which states as follows:
“26. Courts by which offences are triable.
Subject to the other provisions of this Code,
xxx xxx xxx
(b) any offence under any other law shall, when any Court
is mentioned in this behalf in such law, be tried by such
Court and when no Court is so mentioned, may be tried by
—
(i) the High Court, or
(ii) any other Court by which such offence is shown in the
First Schedule to be triable.”
11.Section 167 of the Code makes it clear that whenever a person is
arrested and detained in custody, the time for investigation relating to
an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or
imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years, cannot ordinarily be
beyond the period of 15 days, but is extendable, on the Magistrate
being satisfied that adequate grounds exist for so doing, to a
maximum period of 90 days – See first proviso (a)(i) to Section 167(2)
of the Code. The said proviso goes on to state that the accused
person shall be released on bail if he is prepared to and does furnish
bail on expiry of the maximum period of 90 days, and every person so
9released on bail be deemed to be so released under the provisions of
Chapter XXXIII for the purposes of that Chapter.
12.The First Schedule to the Code then sets out at the fag end, in Part II
thereof, classification of offences against other laws as follows:
THE FIRST SCHEDULE
CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES
II.—CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENCES AGAINST OTHER
LAWS
Offence Cognizable Bailable or By what
or non- non- court
cognizable bailable triable
If punishable with Cognizable Non- Court of
death, bailable Session
imprisonment for
life, or
imprisonment for
more than 7 years
If punishable with Ditto Ditto Magistrate
imprisonment for 3 of first
years and upwards class
and not more than
7 years
If punishable with Non- Bailable Any
imprisonment for cognizable Magistrate
less than 3 years or
with fine only
13.The UAPA deals with “unlawful activity” and “unlawful association”, and
interdicts both unlawful activity and unlawful association as defined
under Sections 2(o) and 2(p). It further defines what are terrorist acts,
terrorist gangs and terrorists organisations under Section 2(k), 2(l) and
2(m) and proscribes each of these in offences which are than fleshed
10out under its provisions. What is important from our point of view in this
case is the definition of “Court” in Section 2(1)(d) of UAPA which is as
follows:
“2. Definitions.-(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise
requires,-
xxx xxx xxx
(d) “court” means a criminal court having jurisdiction, under
the Code, to try offences under this Act and includes a
Special Court constituted under section 11 or under section
21 of the National Investigation Agency Act, 2008”
Equally important is the provision contained in Section 43-D(2) of
UAPA, which is set out as follows:
“43-D. Modified application of certain provisions of the
Code.
xxx xxx xxx
(2) Section 167 of the Code shall apply in relation to a case
involving an offence punishable under this Act subject to
the modification that in sub-section (2),-
(a) the references to “fifteen days”, “ninety days” and
“sixty days”, wherever they occur, shall be construed as
references to “thirty days”, “ninety days” and “ninety
days” respectively; and
(b) after the proviso, the following provisos shall be
inserted, namely:—
“Provided further that if it is not possible to complete
the investigation within the said period of ninety days,
the Court may if it is satisfied with the report of the
Public Prosecutor indicating the progress of the
investigation and the specific reasons for the
detention of the accused beyond the said period of
11ninety days, extend the said period up to one
hundred and eighty days:
Provided also that if the police officer making the
investigation under this Act, requests, for the
purposes of investigation, for police custody from
judicial custody of any person in judicial custody, he
shall file an affidavit stating the reasons for doing so
and shall also explain the delay, if any, for requesting
such police custody.””
14.A cursory reading of these provisions would show that the offences
under the UAPA under Sections 16, 17, 18, 18-A, 18-B, 19, 20, 22-B,
22-C and 23, being offences which contain maximum sentences of
over 7 years, would be exclusively triable by a Court of Sessions when
read with Part II of the First Schedule to the Code. It is only after the
NIA Act was enacted that the definition of “Court” was extended to
include Special Courts that were set up under Section 11 or Section
22 of the NIA Act.
15.When we come to the NIA Act, the Preamble of the said Act indicates
the thrust of the provisions of that Act as follows:
“An Act to constitute an investigation agency at the national
level to investigate and prosecute offences affecting the
sovereignty, security and integrity of India, security of State,
friendly relations with foreign States and offences under
Acts enacted to implement international treaties,
agreements, conventions and resolutions of the United
Nations, its agencies and other international organisations
and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.”
Under Section 2(g) “Scheduled Offence” is defined as follows:
“2. Definitions.- (1) In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,-
xxx xxx xxx
12(g) “Scheduled Offence” means an offence specified in the
Schedule””
Section 2(h) defines “Special Court” as follows:
“2. Definitions.- (1) In this Act, unless the context
otherwise requires,-
xxx xxx xxx
(h) “Special Court” means a Special Court constituted
under section 11 or, as the case may be, under section 22”
16.Section 3 constitutes a National Investigation Agency which is a
special agency set up for prosecution of offences under the Acts
specified in the Schedule by the Central Government. It may be noted
that the UAPA is Item 2 of the said Schedule. Section 10, upon which
strong reliance is placed by the State, is as follows:
“10. Power of State Government to investigate
Scheduled Offences.—Save as otherwise provided in this
Act, nothing contained in this Act shall affect the powers of
the State Government to investigate and prosecute any
Scheduled Offence or other offences under any law for the
time being in force”
Sections 11 and 22 which speak of the power of the Central
Government and the State Government respectively, to designate
Courts of Sessions as Special Courts, are as follows:
“11. Power of Central Government to constitute Special
Courts.—
(1) The Central Government shall, by notification in the
Official Gazette, for the trial of Scheduled Offences,
constitute one or more Special Courts for such area or
areas, or for such case or class or group of cases, as may
be specified in the notification.
13(2) Where any question arises as to the jurisdiction of any
Special Court, it shall be referred to the Central
Government whose decision in the matter shall be final.
(3) A Special Court shall be presided over by a judge to be
appointed by the Central Government on the
recommendation of the Chief Justice of the High Court.
(4) The Agency may make an application to the Chief
Justice of the High Court for appointment of a Judge to
preside over the Special Court.
(5) On receipt of an application under sub-section (4), the
Chief Justice shall, as soon as possible and not later than
seven days, recommend the name of a judge for being
appointed to preside over the Special Court.
(6) The Central Government may, if required, appoint an
additional judge or additional judges to the Special Court,
on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the High
Court.
(7) A person shall not be qualified for appointment as a
judge or an additional judge of a Special Court unless he
is, immediately before such appointment, a Sessions
Judge or an Additional Sessions Judge in any State.
(8) For the removal of doubts, it is hereby provided that the
attainment, by a person appointed as a judge or an
additional judge of a Special Court, of the age of
superannuation under the rules applicable to him in the
service to which he belongs shall not affect his continuance
as such judge or additional judge and the Central
Government may by order direct that he shall continue as
judge until a specified date or until completion of the trial of
the case or cases before him as may be specified in that
order.
(9) Where any additional judge or additional judges is or
are appointed in a Special Court, the judge of the Special
Court may, from time to time, by general or special order, in
writing, provide for the distribution of business of the
Special Court among all judges including himself and the
additional judge or additional judges and also for the
disposal of urgent business in the event of his absence or
the absence of any additional judge.
1422. Power of State Government to constitute Special
Courts.—
(1) The State Government may constitute one or more
Special Courts for the trial of offences under any or all the
enactments specified in the Schedule.
(2) The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the Special
Courts constituted by the State Government under sub-
section (1) and shall have effect subject to the following
modifications, namely—
(i) references to “Central Government” in sections 11 and
15 shall be construed as references to State Government;
(ii) reference to “Agency” in sub-section (1) of section 13
shall be construed as a reference to the “investigation
agency of the State Government”;
(iii) reference to “Attorney-General for India” in sub-section
(3) of section 13 shall be construed as reference to
“Advocate-General of the State”.
(3) The jurisdiction conferred by this Act on a Special Court
shall, until a Special Court is constituted by the State
Government under sub-section (1) in the case of any
offence punishable under this Act, notwithstanding anything
contained in the Code, be exercised by the Court of
Session of the division in which such offence has been
committed and it shall have all the powers and follow the
procedure provided under this Chapter.
(4) On and from the date when the Special Court is
constituted by the State Government the trial of any
offence investigated by the State Government under the
provisions of this Act, which would have been required to
be held before the Special Court, shall stand transferred to
that Court on the date on which it is constituted.”
Section 13 speaks of the jurisdiction of the Special Courts as follows:
“13. Jurisdiction of Special Courts.—
(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, every
Scheduled Offence investigated by the Agency shall be
tried only by the Special Court within whose local
jurisdiction it was committed.
15(2) If, having regard to the exigencies of the situation
prevailing in a State if,—
(a) it is not possible to have a fair, impartial or speedy trial;
or
(b) it is not feasible to have the trial without occasioning the
breach of peace or grave risk to the safety of the accused,
the witnesses, the Public Prosecutor or a judge of the
Special Court or any of them; or
(c) it is not otherwise in the interests of justice, the
Supreme Court may transfer any case pending before a
Special Court to any other Special Court within that State
or in any other State and the High Court may transfer any
case pending before a Special Court situated in that State
to any other Special Court within the State.
(3) The Supreme Court or the High Court, as the case may
be, may act under this section either on the application of
the Central Government or a party interested and any such
application shall be made by motion, which shall, except
when the applicant is the Attorney-General for India, be
supported by an affidavit or affirmation.”
Section 14 clarifies that Special Courts may also try offences other
than the scheduled offences as follows:
“14. Powers of Special Courts with respect to other
offences.—
(1) When trying any offence, a Special Court may also try
any other offence with which the accused may, under the
Code be charged, at the same trial if the offence is
connected with such other offence.
(2) If, in the course of any trial under this Act of any
offence, it is found that the accused person has committed
any other offence under this Act or under any other law, the
Special Court may convict such person of such other
offence and pass any sentence or award punishment
authorised by this Act or, as the case may be, under such
other law.”
16Section 16 is important and sets out the procedure and powers of
Special Courts as follows:
“16. Procedure and powers of Special Courts.—
(1) A Special Court may take cognizance of any offence,
without the accused being committed to it for trial, upon
receiving a complaint of facts that constitute such offence
or upon a police report of such facts.
(2) Where an offence triable by a Special Court is
punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding
three years or with fine or with both, the Special Court may,
notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1) of
section 260 or section 262 of the Code, try the offence in a
summary way in accordance with the procedure prescribed
in the Code and the provisions of sections 263 to 265 of
the Code shall, so far as may be, apply to such trial:
Provided that when, in the course of a summary trial under
this sub-section, it appears to the Special Court that the
nature of the case is such that it is not desirable to try it in a
summary way, the Special Court shall recall any witnesses
who may have been examined and proceed to re-hear the
case in the manner provided by the provisions of the Code
for the trial of such offence and the said provisions shall
apply to, and in relation to, a Special Court as they apply to
and in relation to a Magistrate:
Provided further that in the case of any conviction in a
summary trial under this section, it shall be lawful for a
Special Court to pass a sentence of imprisonment for a
term not exceeding one year and with fine which may
extend to five lakh rupees.
(3) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, a Special
Court shall, for the purpose of trial of any offence, have all
the powers of a Court of Session and shall try such offence
as if it were a Court of Session so far as may be in
accordance with the procedure prescribed in the Code for
the trial before a Court of Session.
(4) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, every case
transferred to a Special Court under sub-section (2) of
17section 13 shall be dealt with as if such case had been
transferred under section 406 of the Code to such Special
Court.
(5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, but
subject to the provisions of section 299 of the Code, a
Special Court may, if it thinks fit and for reasons to be
recorded by it, proceed with the trial in the absence of the
accused or his pleader and record the evidence of any
witness, subject to the right of the accused to recall the
witness for cross-examination.”
17.The Scheme of the NIA Act is that offences under the enactments
contained to the Schedule to the Act are now to be tried exclusively by
Special Courts set up under that Act. These may be set up by the
Central Government under Section 11 or by the State Government
under Section 22 of the Act. On the facts of the present case, we are
concerned with Section 22 as Special Courts have been set up within
the State of Punjab by a notification dated 10.06.2014, which reads as
follows:
“PART III
GOVERNMENT OF PUNJAB
DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS AND JUSTICE
(JUDICIAL-1 BRANCH)
NOTIFICATION
The 10th June, 2014
No. S.O. 141/C.A.34/2008/S.22/2014.- In exercise of the
powers conferred under sub-section(1) of section 22 of the
National Investigation Agency Act, 2008 (Central Act No. 34
of 2008), and all other powers enabling him in this behalf,
the Governor of Punjab, with the concurrence of Hon'ble
Chief Justice of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana,
18Chandigarh, is pleased to constitute the courts of Sessions
Judge and the first Additional Sessions Judge (for the area
falling within their respective jurisdiction), at each district
headquarter in the State, to be the Special Courts, for the
trial of offences as specified in the Schedule appended to
the aforesaid Act, which are investigated by the State
police.”
18.It will be seen that the aforesaid notification has been issued under
Section 22(1) of the NIA Act. What is important to note is that under
Section 22(2)(ii), reference to the Central Agency in Section 13(1) is to
be construed as a reference to the investigation agency of the State
Government – namely, the State police in this case. Thereafter, what is
important to note is that notwithstanding anything contained in the
Code, the jurisdiction conferred on a Special Court shall, until a
Special Court is designated by the State Government, be exercised
only by the Court of Sessions of the Division in which such offence has
been committed vide sub-section (3) of Section 22; and by sub-section
(4) of Section 22, on and from the date on which the Special Court is
designated by the State Government, the trial of any offence
investigated by the State Government under the provisions of the NIA
Act shall stand transferred to that Court on and from the date on which
it is designated.
19.Section 13(1) of the NIA Act, which again begins with a non-obstante
clause which is notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, read
with Section 22(2)(ii), states that every scheduled offence that is
19investigated by the investigation agency of the State Government is to
be tried exclusively by the Special Court within whose local jurisdiction
it was committed.
20.When these provisions are read along with Section 2(1)(d) and the
provisos in 43-D(2) of the UAPA, the Scheme of the two Acts, which
are to be read together, becomes crystal clear. Under the first proviso
in Section 43-D(2)(b), the 90 day period indicated by the first proviso
to Section 167(2) of the Code can be extended up to a maximum
period of 180 days if “the Court” is satisfied with the report of the public
prosecutor indicating progress of investigation and specific reasons for
detention of the accused beyond the period of 90 days. “The Court”,
when read with the extended definition contained in Section 2(1)(d) of
the UAPA, now speaks of the Special Court constituted under Section
22 of the NIA Act. What becomes clear, therefore, from a reading of
these provisions is that for all offences under the UAPA, the Special
Court alone has exclusive jurisdiction to try such offences. This
becomes even clearer on a reading of Section 16 of the NIA Act which
makes it clear that the Special Court may take cognizance of an
offence without the accused being committed to it for trial upon receipt
of a complaint of facts or upon a police report of such facts. What is
equally clear from a reading of Section 16(2) of the NIA Act is that
even though offences may be punishable with imprisonment for a term
20not exceeding 3 years, the Special Court alone is to try such offence –
albeit in a summary way if it thinks it fit to do so. On a conspectus of
the abovementioned provisions, Section 13 read with Section 22(2)(ii)
of the NIA Act, in particular, the argument of the learned counsel
appearing on behalf of the State of Punjab based on Section 10 of the
said Act has no legs to stand on since the Special Court has exclusive
jurisdiction over every Scheduled Offence investigated by the
investigating agency of the State.
21.Before the NIA Act was enacted, offences under the UAPA were of two
kinds – those with a maximum imprisonment of over 7 years, and
those with a maximum imprisonment of 7 years and under. Under the
Code as applicable to offences against other laws, offences having a
maximum sentence of 7 years and under are triable by the
Magistrate’s Courts, whereas offences having a maximum sentence of
above 7 years are triable by Courts of Sessions. This Scheme has
been completely done away with by the 2008 Act as all scheduled
offences i.e. all offences under the UAPA, whether investigated by the
National Investigation Agency or by the investigating agencies of the
State Government, are to be tried exclusively by Special Courts set up
under that Act. In the absence of any designated Court by notification
issued by either the Central Government or the State Government, the
fall back is upon the Court of Sessions alone. Thus, under the
21aforesaid Scheme what becomes clear is that so far as all offences
under the UAPA are concerned, the Magistrate’s jurisdiction to extend
time under the first proviso in Section 43-D(2)(b) is non-existent, “the
Court” being either a Sessions Court, in the absence of a notification
specifying a Special Court, or the Special Court itself. The impugned
judgment in arriving at the contrary conclusion is incorrect as it has
missed Section 22(2) read with Section 13 of the NIA Act. Also, the
impugned judgement has missed Section 16(1) of the NIA Act which
states that a Special Court may take cognizance of any offence
without the accused being committed to it for trial inter alia upon a
police report of such facts.
22.The second vexed question which arises on the facts of this case is
the question of grant of default bail. It has already been seen that once
the maximum period for investigation of an offence is over, under the
first proviso (a) to Section 167(2), the accused shall be released on
bail, this being an indefeasible right granted by the Code. The extent of
this indefeasible right has been the subject matter of a number of
judgments. A beginning may be made with the judgment in Hitendra
Vishnu Thakur v. State of Maharashtra (1994) 4 SCC 602, which
spoke of “default bail” under the provisions of the Terrorist and
Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as
“TADA”) read with Section 167 of the Code as follows:
22“19. Section 20(4) of TADA makes Section 167 of CrPC
applicable in relation to case involving an offence
punishable under TADA, subject to the modifications
specified therein…while clause (b) provided that reference
in sub-section (2) of Section 167 to ‘15 days’, ‘90 days’ and
‘60 days’ wherever they occur shall be construed as
reference to ‘60 days’, ‘one year’ and ‘one year’
respectively. This section was amended in 1993 by the
Amendment Act 43 of 1993 with effect from 22-5-1993 and
the period of ‘one year’ and ‘one year’ in clause (b) was
reduced to ‘180 days’ and ‘180 days’ respectively, by
modification of sub-section (2) of Section 167. After clause
(b) of sub-section (4) of Section 20 of TADA, another
clause (bb) was inserted which reads:
“(bb) in sub-section (2), after the proviso, the following
proviso shall be inserted, namely:—
‘Provided further that, if it is not possible to complete the
investigation within the said period of one hundred and
eighty days, the Designated Court shall extend the said
period up to one year, on the report of the Public
Prosecutor indicating the progress of the investigation and
the specific reasons for the detention of the accused
beyond the said period of one hundred and eighty days;
and’ ”
20. …Sub-section (2) of Section 167 of the Code lays down
that the Magistrate to whom the accused is forwarded may
authorise his detention in such custody, as he may think fit,
for a term specified in that section. The proviso to sub-
section (2) fixes the outer limit within which the
investigation must be completed and in case the same is
not completed within the said prescribed period, the
accused would acquire a right to seek to be released on
bail and if he is prepared to and does furnish bail, the
Magistrate shall release him on bail and such release shall
be deemed to be grant of bail under Chapter XXXIII of the
Code of Criminal Procedure…Section 167 read with
Section 20(4) of TADA, thus, strictly speaking is not a
provision for “grant of bail” but deals with the maximum
period during which a person accused of an offence may
be kept in custody and detention to enable the investigating
agency to complete the investigation and file the charge-
23sheet, if necessary, in the court. The proviso to Section
167(2) of the Code read with Section 20(4)(b) of TADA,
therefore, creates an indefeasible right in an accused
person on account of the ‘default’ by the investigating
agency in the completion of the investigation within the
maximum period prescribed or extended, as the case may
be, to seek an order for his release on bail. It is for this
reason that an order for release on bail under proviso (a) of
Section 167(2) of the Code read with Section 20(4) of
TADA is generally termed as an “order-on-default” as it is
granted on account of the default of the prosecution to
complete the investigation and file the challan within the
prescribed period. As a consequence of the amendment,
an accused after the expiry of 180 days from the date of his
arrest becomes entitled to bail irrespective of the nature of
the offence with which he is charged where the prosecution
fails to put up challan against him on completion of the
investigation. With the amendment of clause (b) of sub-
section (4) of Section 20 read with the proviso to sub-
section (2) of Section 167 of CrPC an indefeasible right to
be enlarged on bail accrues in favour of the accused if the
police fails to complete the investigation and put up a
challan against him in accordance with law under Section
173 CrPC. An obligation, in such a case, is cast upon the
court, when after the expiry of the maximum period during
which an accused could be kept in custody, to decline the
police request for further remand except in cases governed
by clause (bb) of Section 20(4). There is yet another
obligation also which is cast on the court and that is to
inform the accused of his right of being released on bail
and enable him to make an application in that behalf.
(Hussainara Khatoon case [Hussainara Khatoon v. Home
Secy., State of Bihar, (1980) 1 SCC 98 : 1980 SCC (Cri) 40
: AIR 1979 SC 1369] ). This legal position has been very
ably stated in Aslam Babalal Desai v. State of
Maharashtra [(1992) 4 SCC 272 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 870 : AIR
1993 SC 1] where speaking for the majority, Ahmadi, J.
referred with approval to the law laid down in Rajnikant
Jivanlal Patel v. Intelligence Officer, Narcotic Control
Bureau, New Delhi [(1989) 3 SCC 532 : 1989 SCC (Cri)
612 : AIR 1990 SC 71] wherein it was held that : (SCC p.
288, para 9)
24“The right to bail under Section 167(2) proviso (a) thereto
is absolute. It is a legislative command and not court's
discretion. If the investigating agency fails to file charge-
sheet before the expiry of 90/60 days, as the case may
be, the accused in custody should be released on bail.
But at that stage, merits of the case are not to be
examined. Not at all. In fact, the Magistrate has no power
to remand a person beyond the stipulated period of
90/60 days. He must pass an order of bail and
communicate the same to the accused to furnish the
requisite bail bonds.”
21. Thus, we find that once the period for filing the charge-
sheet has expired and either no extension under clause
(bb) has been granted by the Designated Court or the
period of extension has also expired, the accused person
would be entitled to move an application for being admitted
to bail under sub-section (4) of Section 20 TADA read with
Section 167 of the Code and the Designated
Court shall release him on bail, if the accused seeks to be
so released and furnishes the requisite bail. We are not
impressed with the argument of the learned counsel for the
appellant that on the expiry of the period during which
investigation is required to be completed under Section
20(4) TADA read with Section 167 of the Code, the court
must release the accused on bail on its own motion even
without any application from an accused person on his
offering to furnish bail. In our opinion an accused is
required to make an application if he wishes to be released
on bail on account of the ‘default’ of the
investigating/prosecuting agency and once such an
application is made, the court should issue a notice to the
public prosecutor who may either show that the
prosecution has obtained the order for extension for
completion of investigation from the court under clause (bb)
or that the challan has been filed in the Designated Court
before the expiry of the prescribed period or even that the
prescribed period has actually not expired and thus resist
the grant of bail on the alleged ground of ‘default’. The
issuance of notice would avoid the possibility of an
accused obtaining an order of bail under the ‘default’
clause by either deliberately or inadvertently concealing
certain facts and would avoid multiplicity of proceedings. It
25would, therefore, serve the ends of justice if both sides are
heard on a petition for grant of bail on account of the
prosecution's ‘default’… No other condition like the gravity
of the case, seriousness of the offence or character of the
offender etc. can weigh with the court at that stage to
refuse the grant of bail to an accused under sub-section (4)
of Section 20 TADA on account of the ‘default’ of the
prosecution.”
23.In the Constitution Bench judgment in Sanjay Dutt v. State through
CBI (1994) 5 SCC 410, one of the questions to be decided by the
Constitution Bench was the correct interpretation of Section 20(4)(bb)
of TADA indicating the nature of right of an accused to be released on
default bail. The enigmatic expression “if already not availed of” is
contained in paragraphs 48 of the aforesaid judgment as follows:
“48. We have no doubt that the common stance before us
of the nature of indefeasible right of the accused to be
released on bail by virtue of Section 20(4)(bb) is based on
a correct reading of the principle indicated in that decision.
The indefeasible right accruing to the accused in such a
situation is enforceable only prior to the filing of the challan
and it does not survive or remain enforceable on the
challan being filed, if already not availed of. Once the
challan has been filed, the question of grant of bail has to
be considered and decided only with reference to the
merits of the case under the provisions relating to grant of
bail to an accused after the filing of the challan. The
custody of the accused after the challan has been filed is
not governed by Section 167 but different provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. If that right had accrued to the
accused but it remained unenforced till the filing of the
challan, then there is no question of its enforcement
thereafter since it is extinguished the moment challan is
filed because Section 167 CrPC ceases to apply. The
Division Bench also indicated that if there be such an
application of the accused for release on bail and also a
26prayer for extension of time to complete the investigation
according to the proviso in Section 20(4)(bb), both of them
should be considered together. It is obvious that no bail can
be given even in such a case unless the prayer for
extension of the period is rejected. In short, the grant of bail
in such a situation is also subject to refusal of the prayer for
extension of time, if such a prayer is made. If the accused
applies for bail under this provision on expiry of the period
of 180 days or the extended period, as the case may be,
then he has to be released on bail forthwith. The accused,
so released on bail may be arrested and committed to
custody according to the provisions of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. It is settled by Constitution Bench decisions
that a petition seeking the writ of habeas corpus on the
ground of absence of a valid order of remand or detention
of the accused, has to be dismissed, if on the date of return
of the rule, the custody or detention is on the basis of a
valid order. (See Naranjan Singh Nathawan v. State of
Punjab [1952 SCR 395 : AIR 1952 SC 106 : 1952 Cri LJ
656] ; Ram Narayan Singh v. State of Delhi [1953 SCR 652
: AIR 1953 SC 277 : 1953 Cri LJ 1113] and A.K.
Gopalan v. Government of India [(1966) 2 SCR 427 : AIR
1966 SC 816 : 1966 Cri LJ 602] .)
xxx xxx xxx
53. As a result of the above discussion, our answers to the
three questions of law referred for our decision are as
under:
xxx xxx xxx
(2)(b) The “indefeasible right” of the accused to be released
on bail in accordance with Section 20(4)(bb) of the TADA
Act read with Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure in default of completion of the investigation and
filing of the challan within the time allowed, as held
in Hitendra Vishnu Thakur [(1994) 4 SCC 602 : 1994 SCC
(Cri) 1087 : JT (1994) 4 SC 255] is a right which enures to,
and is enforceable by the accused only from the time of
default till the filing of the challan and it does not survive or
remain enforceable on the challan being filed. If the
accused applies for bail under this provision on expiry of
the period of 180 days or the extended period, as the case
27may be, then he has to be released on bail forthwith. The
accused, so released on bail may be arrested and
committed to custody according to the provisions of the
Code of Criminal Procedure. The right of the accused to be
released on bail after filing of the challan, notwithstanding
the default in filing it within the time allowed, is governed
from the time of filing of the challan only by the provisions
relating to the grant of bail applicable at that stage.”
[Emphasis Supplied]
24.The question as to whether default bail can be granted once a charge
sheet is filed was authoritatively dealt with in a decision of a Three-
Judge Bench of this Court in Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of
Maharashtra (2001) 5 SCC 453. The majority judgment of G.B.
Pattanaik, J. reviewed the decisions of this Court and in particular the
enigmatic expression “if already not availed of” in Sanjay Dutt (supra).
The Court then held:
“13.…The crucial question that arises for consideration,
therefore, is what is the true meaning of the expression “if
already not availed of”? Does it mean that an accused files
an application for bail and offers his willingness for being
released on bail or does it mean that a bail order must be
passed, the accused must furnish the bail and get him
released on bail? In our considered opinion it would be
more in consonance with the legislative mandate to hold
that an accused must be held to have availed of his
indefeasible right, the moment he files an application for
being released on bail and offers to abide by the terms and
conditions of bail. To interpret the expression “availed of” to
mean actually being released on bail after furnishing the
necessary bail required would cause great injustice to the
accused and would defeat the very purpose of the proviso
to Section 167(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code and
further would make an illegal custody to be legal, inasmuch
as after the expiry of the stipulated period the Magistrate
28had no further jurisdiction to remand and such custody of
the accused is without any valid order of remand. That
apart, when an accused files an application for bail
indicating his right to be released as no challan had been
filed within the specified period, there is no discretion left in
the Magistrate and the only thing he is required to find out
is whether the specified period under the statute has
elapsed or not, and whether a challan has been filed or not.
If the expression “availed of” is interpreted to mean that the
accused must factually be released on bail, then in a given
case where the Magistrate illegally refuses to pass an
order notwithstanding the maximum period stipulated in
Section 167 had expired, and yet no challan had been filed
then the accused could only move to the higher forum and
while the matter remains pending in the higher forum for
consideration, if the prosecution files a charge-sheet then
also the so-called right accruing to the accused because of
inaction on the part of the investigating agency would get
frustrated. Since the legislature has given its mandate it
would be the bounden duty of the court to enforce the
same and it would not be in the interest of justice to negate
the same by interpreting the expression “if not availed of” in
a manner which is capable of being abused by the
prosecution. A two-Judge Bench decision of this Court
in State of M.P. v. Rustam [1995 Supp (3) SCC 221 : 1995
SCC (Cri) 830] setting aside the order of grant of bail by
the High Court on a conclusion that on the date of the order
the prosecution had already submitted a police report and,
therefore, the right stood extinguished, in our considered
opinion, does not express the correct position in law of the
expression “if already not availed of”, used by the
Constitution Bench in Sanjay Dutt [(1994) 5 SCC 410 :
1994 SCC (Cri) 1433]…In the aforesaid premises, we are
of the considered opinion that an accused must be held to
have availed of his right flowing from the legislative
mandate engrafted in the proviso to sub-section (2) of
Section 167 of the Code if he has filed an application after
the expiry of the stipulated period alleging that no challan
has been filed and he is prepared to offer the bail that is
ordered, and it is found as a fact that no challan has been
filed within the period prescribed from the date of the arrest
of the accused. In our view, such interpretation would
subserve the purpose and the object for which the
29provision in question was brought on to the statute-book. In
such a case, therefore, even if the application for
consideration of an order of being released on bail is
posted before the court after some length of time, or even if
the Magistrate refuses the application erroneously and the
accused moves the higher forum for getting a formal order
of being released on bail in enforcement of his indefeasible
right, then filing of challan at that stage will not take away
the right of the accused. Personal liberty is one of the
cherished objects of the Indian Constitution and deprivation
of the same can only be in accordance with law and in
conformity with the provisions thereof, as stipulated under
Article 21 of the Constitution. When the law provides that
the Magistrate could authorise the detention of the accused
in custody up to a maximum period as indicated in the
proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167, any further
detention beyond the period without filing of a challan by
the investigating agency would be a subterfuge and would
not be in accordance with law and in conformity with the
provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, and as such,
could be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. There is
no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code authorising
detention of an accused in custody after the expiry of the
period indicated in proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 167
excepting the contingency indicated in Explanation I,
namely, if the accused does not furnish the bail…But so
long as the accused files an application and indicates in the
application to offer bail on being released by appropriate
orders of the court then the right of the accused on being
released on bail cannot be frustrated on the off chance of
the Magistrate not being available and the matter not being
moved, or that the Magistrate erroneously refuses to pass
an order and the matter is moved to the higher forum and a
challan is filed in interregnum. This is the only way how a
balance can be struck between the so-called indefeasible
right of the accused on failure on the part of the
prosecution to file a challan within the specified period and
the interest of the society, at large, in lawfully preventing an
accused from being released on bail on account of inaction
on the part of the prosecuting agency. On the aforesaid
premises, we would record our conclusions as follows:
xxx xxx xxx
303. On the expiry of the said period of 90 days or 60 days,
as the case may be, an indefeasible right accrues in
favour of the accused for being released on bail on
account of default by the investigating agency in the
completion of the investigation within the period
prescribed and the accused is entitled to be released on
bail, if he is prepared to and furnishes the bail as
directed by the Magistrate.
xxx xxx xxx
6. The expression “if not already availed of” used by this
Court in Sanjay Dutt case [(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994
SCC (Cri) 1433] must be understood to mean when the
accused files an application and is prepared to offer bail
on being directed. In other words, on expiry of the period
specified in para (a) of the proviso to sub-section (2) of
Section 167 if the accused files an application for bail
and offers also to furnish the bail on being directed, then
it has to be held that the accused has availed of his
indefeasible right even though the court has not
considered the said application and has not indicated the
terms and conditions of bail, and the accused has not
furnished the same.”
[Emphasis Supplied]
B.N. Agrawal J. dissented, holding:
“29. My learned brother has referred to the expression “if
not already availed of” referred to in the judgment in Sanjay
Dutt case [(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1433] for
arriving at Conclusion 6. According to me, the expression
“availed of” does not mean mere filing of application for bail
expressing therein willingness of the accused to furnish the
bail bond. What will happen if on the 61st day an
application for bail is filed for being released on bail on the
ground of default by not filing the challan by the 60th day
and on the 61st day the challan is also filed by the time the
Magistrate is called upon to apply his mind to the challan
as well as the petition for grant of bail? In view of the
several decisions referred to above and the requirements
prescribed by clause (a)(ii) of the proviso read with
Explanation I to Section 167(2) of the Code, as no bail
31bond has been furnished, such an application for bail has
to be dismissed because the stage of proviso to Section
167(2) is over, as such right is extinguished the moment
the challan is filed.
30. In this background, the expression “availed of” does not
mean mere filing of the application for bail expressing
thereunder willingness to furnish bail bond, but the stage
for actual furnishing of bail bond must reach. If the challan
is filed before that, then there is no question of enforcing
the right, howsoever valuable or indefeasible it may be,
after filing of the challan because thereafter the right under
default clause cannot be exercised.”
25.The law laid down by the majority judgment in this case was however
not followed in Pragya Singh Thakur v. State of Maharashtra (2011)
10 SCC 445. This hiccup in the law was then cleared by the judgment
in Union of India v. Nirala Yadav (2014) 9 SCC 457, which
exhaustively discussed the entire case law on the subject. In this
judgment, a Two-Judge Bench of this Court referred to all the relevant
authorities on the subject including the majority judgment of Uday
Mohanlal Acharya (supra) and then concluded:
“44. At this juncture, it is absolutely essential to delve into
what were the precise principles stated in Uday Mohanlal
Acharya case [(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760]
and how the two-Judge Bench has understood the same
in Pragyna Singh Thakur [(2011) 10 SCC 445 : (2012) 1
SCC (Cri) 311] . We have already reproduced the
paragraphs in extenso from Uday Mohanlal Acharya
case [(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] and the
relevant paragraphs from Pragyna Singh Thakur [(2011) 10
SCC 445 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 311] . Pragyna Singh
Thakur [(2011) 10 SCC 445 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 311] has
drawn support from Rustam [1995 Supp (3) SCC 221 :
1995 SCC (Cri) 830] case to buttress the principle it has
32laid down though in Uday Mohanlal Acharya case [(2001) 5
SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] the said decision has been
held not to have stated the correct position of law and,
therefore, the same could not have been placed reliance
upon. The Division Bench in para 56 which has been
reproduced hereinabove, has referred to para 13 and the
conclusions of Uday Mohanlal Acharya case [(2001) 5 SCC
453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] . We have already quoted from
para 13 and the conclusions.
45. The opinion expressed in paras 54 and 58 in Pragyna
Singh Thakur [(2011) 10 SCC 445 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri)
311] which we have emphasised, as it seems to us, runs
counter to the principles stated in Uday Mohanlal
Acharya [(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] which
has been followed in Hassan Ali Khan [(2011) 10 SCC
235 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 256] and Sayed Mohd. Ahmad
Kazmi [(2012) 12 SCC 1 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 488] . The
decision in Sayed Mohd. Ahmad Kazmi case [(2012) 12
SCC 1 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 488] has been rendered by a
three-Judge Bench. We may hasten to state, though
in Pragyna Singh Thakur case [(2011) 10 SCC 445 : (2012)
1 SCC (Cri) 311] the learned Judges have referred to Uday
Mohanlal Acharya case [(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC
(Cri) 760] but have stated the principle that even if an
application for bail is filed on the ground that the charge-
sheet was not filed within 90 days, but before the
consideration of the same and before being released on
bail, if the charge-sheet is filed the said right to be enlarged
on bail is lost. This opinion is contrary to the earlier larger
Bench decisions and also runs counter to the subsequent
three-Judge Bench decision in Mustaq Ahmed Mohammed
Isak case [(2009) 7 SCC 480 : (2009) 3 SCC (Cri) 449] .
We are disposed to think so, as the two-Judge Bench has
used the words “before consideration of the same and
before being released on bail”, the said principle
specifically strikes a discordant note with the proposition
stated in the decisions rendered by the larger Benches.
46. At this juncture, it will be appropriate to refer to the
dissenting opinion by B.N. Agarwal, J. in Uday Mohanlal
Acharya case [(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] .
33The learned Judge dissented with the majority as far as
interpretation of the expression “if not already availed of” by
stating so: (SCC p. 481, paras 29-30)
“29. My learned Brother has referred to the expression ‘if
not already availed of’ referred to in the judgment
in Sanjay Dutt case [(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC (Cri)
1433] for arriving at Conclusion 6. According to me, the
expression ‘availed of’ does not mean mere filing of
application for bail expressing therein willingness of the
accused to furnish the bail bond. What will happen if on
the 61st day an application for bail is filed for being
released on bail on the ground of default by not filing the
challan by the 60th day and on the 61st day the challan
is also filed by the time the Magistrate is called upon to
apply his mind to the challan as well as the petition for
grant of bail? In view of the several decisions referred to
above and the requirements prescribed by clause (a)(ii)
of the proviso read with Explanation I to Section 167(2)
of the Code, as no bail bond has been furnished, such
an application for bail has to be dismissed because the
stage of proviso to Section 167(2) is over, as such right
is extinguished the moment the challan is filed.
30. In this background, the expression ‘availed of’ does
not mean mere filing of the application for bail expressing
thereunder willingness to furnish bail bond, but the stage
for actual furnishing of bail bond must reach. If the
challan is filed before that, then there is no question of
enforcing the right, howsoever valuable or indefeasible it
may be, after filing of the challan because thereafter the
right under default clause cannot be exercised.”
On a careful reading of the aforesaid two paragraphs, we
think, the two-Judge Bench in Pragyna Singh Thakur
case [(2011) 10 SCC 445 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 311] has
somewhat in a similar matter stated the same. As long as
the majority view occupies the field it is a binding
precedent. That apart, it has been followed by a three-
Judge Bench in Sayed Mohd. Ahmad Kazmi case [(2012)
12 SCC 1 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 488] . Keeping in view the
principle stated in Sayed Mohd. Ahmad Kazmi case [(2012)
12 SCC 1 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri) 488] which is based on
three-Judge Bench decision in Uday Mohanlal Acharya
34case [(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] , we are
obliged to conclude and hold that the principle laid down in
paras 54 and 58 of Pragyna Singh Thakur case [(2011) 10
SCC 445 : (2012) 1 SCC (Cri) 311] (which has been
emphasised by us: see paras 42 and 43 above) does not
state the correct principle of law. It can clearly be stated
that in view of the subsequent decision of a larger Bench
that cannot be treated to be good law. Our view finds
support from the decision in Union of India v. Arviva
Industries India Ltd. [(2014) 3 SCC 159].”
26. Also, in Syed Mohd. Ahmad Kazmi v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi)
(2012) 12 SCC 1, Section 43-D of the UAPA came up for
consideration before the Court, in particular the proviso which extends
the period for investigation beyond 90 days up to a period of 180 days.
An application for default bail had been made on 17.07.2012, as no
charge sheet was filed within a period of 90 days of the appellant’s
custody. The charge sheet in the aforesaid case was filed thereafter
on 31.07.2012. Despite the fact that this application was not taken up
for hearing before the filing of the charge sheet, this Court held that
this since an application for default bail had been filed prior to the filing
of the charge sheet the “indefeasible right” spoken of earlier had
sprung into action, as a result of which default bail had to be granted.
The Court held:
“25. Having carefully considered the submissions made on
behalf of the respective parties, the relevant provisions of
law and the decision cited, we are unable to accept the
submissions advanced on behalf of the State by the
learned Additional Solicitor General Mr Raval. There is no
35denying the fact that on 17-7-2012, when CR No. 86 of
2012 was allowed by the Additional Sessions Judge and
the custody of the appellant was held to be illegal and an
application under Section 167(2) CrPC was made on
behalf of the appellant for grant of statutory bail which was
listed for hearing. Instead of hearing the application, the
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate adjourned the same till the
next day when the Public Prosecutor filed an application for
extension of the period of custody and investigation and on
20-7-2012 extended the time of investigation and the
custody of the appellant for a further period of 90 days with
retrospective effect from 2-6-2012. Not only is the
retrospectivity of the order of the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate untenable, it could not also defeat the statutory
right which had accrued to the appellant on the expiry of 90
days from the date when the appellant was taken into
custody. Such right, as has been commented upon by this
Court in Sanjay Dutt [(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC (Cri)
1433] and the other cases cited by the learned Additional
Solicitor General, could only be distinguished
(sic extinguished) once the charge-sheet had been filed in
the case and no application has been made prior thereto
for grant of statutory bail. It is well-established that if an
accused does not exercise his right to grant of statutory
bail before the charge-sheet is filed, he loses his right to
such benefit once such charge-sheet is filed and can,
thereafter, only apply for regular bail.
26. The circumstances in this case, however, are different
in that the appellant had exercised his right to statutory bail
on the very same day on which his custody was held to be
illegal and such an application was left undecided by the
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate till after the application filed
by the prosecution for extension of time to complete
investigation was taken up and orders were passed
thereupon.
27. We are unable to appreciate the procedure adopted by
the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, which has been
endorsed by the High Court and we are of the view that the
appellant acquired the right for grant of statutory bail on 17-
7-2012, when his custody was held to be illegal by the
Additional Sessions Judge since his application for
statutory bail was pending at the time when the application
36for extension of time for continuing the investigation was
filed by the prosecution. In our view, the right of the
appellant to grant of statutory bail remained unaffected by
the subsequent application and both the Chief Metropolitan
Magistrate and the High Court erred in holding otherwise.”
27.In a fairly recent judgment reported as Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State
of Assam (2017) 15 SCC 67, a Three-Judge Bench of this Court
referred to the earlier decisions of this Court and went one step further.
It was held by the majority judgment of Madan B. Lokur, J. and
Deepak Gupta, J. that even an oral application for grant of default bail
would suffice, and so long as such application is made before the
charge sheet is filed by the police, default bail must be granted. This
was stated in Lokur, J.’s judgment as follows:
“37. This Court had occasion to review the entire case law
on the subject in Union of India v. Nirala Yadav [Union of
India v. Nirala Yadav, (2014) 9 SCC 457 : (2014) 5 SCC
(Cri) 212] . In that decision, reference was made to Uday
Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra [Uday Mohanlal
Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001
SCC (Cri) 760] and the conclusions arrived at in that
decision. We are concerned with Conclusion (3) which
reads as follows: (Nirala Yadav case [Union of
India v. Nirala Yadav, (2014) 9 SCC 457 : (2014) 5 SCC
(Cri) 212] , SCC p. 472, para 24)
“‘13. (3) On the expiry of the said period of 90 days or 60
days, as the case may be, an indefeasible right accrues
in favour of the accused for being released on bail on
account of default by the investigating agency in the
completion of the investigation within the period
prescribed and the accused is entitled to be released on
bail, if he is prepared to and furnishes the bail as
directed by the Magistrate.’ (Uday Mohanlal case [Uday
Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra, (2001) 5 SCC
453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] , SCC p. 473, para 13)”
3738. This Court also dealt with the decision rendered
in Sanjay Dutt [Sanjay Dutt v. State, (1994) 5 SCC 410 :
1994 SCC (Cri) 1433] and noted that the principle laid
down by the Constitution Bench is to the effect that if the
charge-sheet is not filed and the right for “default bail” has
ripened into the status of indefeasibility, it cannot be
frustrated by the prosecution on any pretext. The accused
can avail his liberty by filing an application stating that the
statutory period for filing the charge-sheet or challan has
expired and the same has not yet been filed and therefore
the indefeasible right has accrued in his or her favour and
further the accused is prepared to furnish the bail bond.
39. This Court also noted that apart from the possibility of
the prosecution frustrating the indefeasible right, there are
occasions when even the court frustrates the indefeasible
right. Reference was made to Mohd. Iqbal Madar
Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra [Mohd. Iqbal Madar
Sheikh v. State of Maharashtra, (1996) 1 SCC 722 : 1996
SCC (Cri) 202] wherein it was observed that some courts
keep the application for “default bail” pending for some
days so that in the meantime a charge-sheet is submitted.
While such a practice both on the part of the prosecution
as well as some courts must be very strongly and
vehemently discouraged, we reiterate that no subterfuge
should be resorted to, to defeat the indefeasible right of the
accused for “default bail” during the interregnum when the
statutory period for filing the charge-sheet or challan
expires and the submission of the charge-sheet or challan
in court.
Procedure for obtaining default bail
40. In the present case, it was also argued by the learned
counsel for the State that the petitioner did not apply for
“default bail” on or after 4-1-2017 till 24-1-2017 on which
date his indefeasible right got extinguished on the filing of
the charge-sheet. Strictly speaking, this is correct since the
petitioner applied for regular bail on 11-1-2017 in the
Gauhati High Court — he made no specific application for
grant of “default bail”. However, the application for regular
38bail filed by the accused on 11-1-2017 did advert to the
statutory period for filing a charge-sheet having expired
and that perhaps no charge-sheet had in fact being filed. In
any event, this issue was argued by the learned counsel for
the petitioner in the High Court and it was considered but
not accepted by the High Court. The High Court did not
reject the submission on the ground of maintainability but
on merits. Therefore it is not as if the petitioner did not
make any application for default bail — such an application
was definitely made (if not in writing) then at least orally
before the High Court. In our opinion, in matters of
personal liberty, we cannot and should not be too technical
and must lean in favour of personal liberty. Consequently,
whether the accused makes a written application for
“default bail” or an oral application for “default bail” is of no
consequence. The court concerned must deal with such an
application by considering the statutory requirements,
namely, whether the statutory period for filing a charge-
sheet or challan has expired, whether the charge-sheet or
challan has been filed and whether the accused is
prepared to and does furnish bail.
41. We take this view keeping in mind that in matters of
personal liberty and Article 21 of the Constitution, it is not
always advisable to be formalistic or technical. The history
of the personal liberty jurisprudence of this Court and other
constitutional courts includes petitions for a writ of habeas
corpus and for other writs being entertained even on the
basis of a letter addressed to the Chief Justice or the
Court.

Application of the law to the petitioner
45. On 11-1-2017 [Rakesh Kumar Paul v. State of Assam,
2017 SCC OnLine Gau 573] when the High Court
dismissed the application for bail filed by the petitioner, he
had an indefeasible right to the grant of “default bail” since
the statutory period of 60 days for filing a charge-sheet had
expired, no charge-sheet or challan had been filed against
him (it was filed only on 24-1-2017) and the petitioner had
39orally applied for “default bail”. Under these circumstances,
the only course open to the High Court on 11-1-2017 was
to enquire from the petitioner whether he was prepared to
furnish bail and if so then to grant him “default bail” on
reasonable conditions. Unfortunately, this was completely
overlooked by the High Court.
46. It was submitted that as of today, a charge-sheet
having been filed against the petitioner, he is not entitled to
“default bail” but must apply for regular bail — the “default
bail” chapter being now closed. We cannot agree for the
simple reason that we are concerned with the interregnum
between 4-1-2017 and 24-1-2017 when no charge-sheet
had been filed, during which period he had availed of his
indefeasible right of “default bail”. It would have been
another matter altogether if the petitioner had not applied
for “default bail” for whatever reason during this
interregnum. There could be a situation (however rare)
where an accused is not prepared to be bailed out perhaps
for his personal security since he or she might be facing
some threat outside the correction home or for any other
reason. But then in such an event, the accused voluntarily
gives up the indefeasible right for default bail and having
forfeited that right the accused cannot, after the charge-
sheet or challan has been filed, claim a resuscitation of the
indefeasible right. But that is not the case insofar as the
petitioner is concerned, since he did not give up his
indefeasible right for “default bail” during the interregnum
between 4-1-2017 and 24-1-2017 as is evident from the
decision of the High Court rendered on 11-1-2017 [Rakesh
Kumar Paul v. State of Assam, 2017 SCC OnLine Gau 573]
. On the contrary, he had availed of his right to “default bail”
which could not have been defeated on 11-1-2017 and
which we are today compelled to acknowledge and
enforce.
47. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the petitioner
had satisfied all the requirements of obtaining “default bail”
which is that on 11-1-2017 he had put in more than 60
days in custody pending investigations into an alleged
offence not punishable with imprisonment for a minimum
period of 10 years, no charge-sheet had been filed against
40him and he was prepared to furnish bail for his release, as
such, he ought to have been released by the High Court on
reasonable terms and conditions of bail.
xxx xxx xxx
49. The petitioner is held entitled to the grant of “default
bail” on the facts and in the circumstances of this case. The
trial Judge should release the petitioner on “default bail” on
such terms and conditions as may be reasonable.
However, we make it clear that this does not prohibit or
otherwise prevent the arrest or re-arrest of the petitioner on
cogent grounds in respect of the subject charge and upon
arrest or re-arrest, the petitioner is entitled to petition for
grant of regular bail which application should be considered
on its own merit. We also make it clear that this will not
impact on the arrest of the petitioner in any other case.”
28.Deepak Gupta, J. in his concurring opinion agreed with Lokur, J. as
follows:
“82. The right to get “default bail” is a very important right.
Ours is a country where millions of our countrymen are
totally illiterate and not aware of their rights. A Constitution
Bench of this Court in Sanjay Dutt [Sanjay Dutt v. State,
(1994) 5 SCC 410 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 1433] has held that the
accused must apply for grant of “default bail”. As far as
Section 167 of the Code is concerned, Explanation I to
Section 167 provides that notwithstanding the expiry of the
period specified (i.e. 60 days or 90 days, as the case may
be), the accused can be detained in custody so long as he
does not furnish bail. Explanation I to Section 167 of the
Code reads as follows:
“Explanation I.—For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby
declared that, notwithstanding the expiry of the period
specified in para (a), the accused shall be detained in
custody so long as he does not furnish bail.”
41This would, in my opinion, mean that even though the
period had expired, the accused would be deemed to be in
legal custody till he does not furnish bail. The requirement
is of furnishing of bail. The accused does not have to make
out any grounds for grant of bail. He does not have to file a
detailed application. All he has to aver in the application is
that since 60/90 days have expired and charge-sheet has
not been filed, he is entitled to bail and is willing to furnish
bail. This indefeasible right cannot be defeated by filing the
charge-sheet after the accused has offered to furnish bail.
xxx xxx xxx
86. I agree and concur with the conclusions drawn and
directions given by learned Brother Lokur, J. in paras 49 to
51 of his judgment.”
P.C. Pant, J., however, dissented holding:
“113. The law laid down as above shows that the
requirement of an application claiming the statutory right
under Section 167(2) of the Code is a prerequisite for the
grant of bail on default. In my opinion, such application has
to be made before the Magistrate for enforcement of the
statutory right. In the cases under the Prevention of
Corruption Act or other Acts where Special Courts are
constituted by excluding the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, it
has to be made before such Special Court. In the present
case, for the reasons discussed, since the appellant never
sought default bail before the court concerned, as such is
not entitled to the same.”
A conspectus of the aforesaid decisions would show that so long as
an application for grant of default bail is made on expiry of the period
of 90 days (which application need not even be in writing) before a
charge sheet is filed, the right to default bail becomes complete. It is of
no moment that the Criminal Court in question either does not dispose
42of such application before the charge sheet is filed or disposes of such
application wrongly before such charge sheet is filed. So long as an
application has been made for default bail on expiry of the stated
period before time is further extended to the maximum period of 180
days, default bail, being an indefeasible right of the accused under the
first proviso to Section 167(2), kicks in and must be granted.
29.On the facts of the present case, the High Court was wholly incorrect
in stating that once the challan was presented by the prosecution on
25.03.2019 as an application was filed by the Appellant on 26.03.2019,
the Appellant is not entitled to default bail. First and foremost, the High
Court has got the dates all wrong. The application that was made for
default bail was made on or before 25.02.2019 and not 26.03.2019.
The charge sheet was filed on 26.03.2019 and not 25.03.2019. The
fact that this application was wrongly dismissed on 25.02.2019 would
make no difference and ought to have been corrected in revision. The
sole ground for dismissing the application was that the time of 90 days
had already been extended by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial
Magistrate, Ajnala by his order dated 13.02.2019. This Order was
correctly set aside by the Special Court by its judgment dated
25.03.2019, holding that under the UAPA read with the NIA Act, the
Special Court alone had jurisdiction to extend time to 180 days under
the first proviso in Section 43-D(2)(b). The fact that the Appellant filed
43yet another application for default bail on 08.04.2019, would not mean
that this application would wipe out the effect of the earlier application
that had been wrongly decided. We must not forget that we are dealing
with the personal liberty of an accused under a statute which imposes
drastic punishments. The right to default bail, as has been correctly
held by the judgments of this Court, are not mere statutory rights
under the first proviso to Section 167(2) of the Code, but is part of the
procedure established by law under Article 21 of the Constitution of
India, which is, therefore, a fundamental right granted to an accused
person to be released on bail once the conditions of the first proviso to
Section 167(2) are fulfilled. This being the case, we set aside the
judgment of the High Court. The Appellant will now be entitled to be
released on “default bail” under Section 167(2) of the Code, as
amended by Section 43-D of the UAPA. However, we make it clear
that this does not prohibit or otherwise prevent the arrest or re-arrest of
the petitioner on cogent grounds, and upon arrest or re-arrest, the
petitioner is entitled to petition for the grant of regular bail which
application should be considered on its own merit. We also make it
clear that this judgement will have no impact on the arrest of the
petitioner in any other case.
30.The appeal is, accordingly, allowed, and the impugned judgement of
the High Court is set aside.
