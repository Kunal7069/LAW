JUDGMENT
BANERJEE,J.
Four decades ago, the Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh
(Mohan Singh v. State of Punjab 1962 Supp. (3) SCR 848) has
been rather lucid in its expression as regards differentiation
between Section 149 and Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. In
Mohan Singh this Court stated :
". Like Section 149, Section 34 also deals with
cases of constructive criminal liability. It provides that
where a criminal act is done by several persons in
furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such
persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it
were done by him alone. The essential constituents of
the vicarious criminal liability prescribed by Section 34
is the existence of common intention. If the common
intention in question animates the accused persons and
if the said common intention leads to the commission of
the criminal offence charged, each of the persons
sharing the common intention is constructively liable
for the criminal act done by one of them. Just as the
combination of persons sharing the same common
object is one of the features of an unlawful assembly, so
the existence of a combination of persons sharing the
same common intention is one of the features of
Section 34. In some ways the two sections are similar
and in some cases they may overlap. But,
nevertheless, the common intention which is the basis
of Section 34 is different from the common object
which is the basis of the composition of an unlawful
assembly. Common intention denotes action-in-
concert and necessarily postulates the existence of a
pre-arranged plan and that must mean a prior meeting
of minds. It would be noticed that cases to which
Section 34 can be applied disclose an element of
participation in action on the part of all the accused
persons. The acts may be different; may vary in their
character, but they are all actuated by the same common
intention. It is now well-settled that the common
intention required by Section 34 is different from the
same intention or similar intention. As has been
observed by the Privy Council in Mahbub Shah v.
Emperor (1945 L.R. 72 I.A. 148), common intention
within the meaning of Section 34 implies a pre-http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 10
arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence
applying the section it should be proved that the
criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre-
arranged plan and that the inference of common
intention should never be reached unless it is a
necessary inference deducible from the circumstances
of the case."
Four decades later, however, a Three-Judge Bench of this
Court in Suresh (Suresh & Anr. v. State of U.P. 2001 (3) SCC
673) had the following to state pertaining to Section 34 of the
Indian Penal Code.
"Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises
the principle of vicarious liability in criminal
jurisprudence. It makes a person liable for action of an
offence not committed by him but by another person
with whom he shared the common intention. It is a
rule of evidence and does not create a substantive
offence. The Section gives statutory recognition to the
commonsense principle that if more than two persons
intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if
each of them had done it individually. There is no
gainsaying that a common intention presupposes prior
concert, which requires a prearranged plan of the
accused participating in an offence. Such preconcert or
preplanning may develop on the spot or during the
course of commission of the offence but the crucial test
is that such plan must precede the act constituting an
offence. Common intention can be formed previously
or in the course of occurrence and on the spur of the
moment. The existence of a common intention is a
question of fact in each case to be proved mainly as a
matter of inference from the circumstances of the case.
The dominant feature for attracting Section 34 of
the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as "the
Code") is the element of participation in absence
resulting in the ultimate "criminal act". The "act"
referred to in the later part of Section 34 means the
ultimate criminal act with which the accused is charged
of sharing the common intention. The accused is,
therefore, made responsible for the ultimate criminal act
done by several persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all. The section does not envisage the
separate act by all the accused persons for becoming
responsible for the ultimate criminal act. If such an
interpretation is accepted, the purpose of Section 34
shall be rendered infructuous.
Participation in the crime in furtherance of the
common intention cannot conceive of some
independent criminal act by all accused persons,
besides the ultimate criminal act because for that
individual act law takes care of making such accused
responsible under the other provisions of the Code.
The word "act" used in Section 34 denotes a series of
acts as a single act. What is required under law is that
the accused persons sharing the common intention must
be physically present at the scene of occurrence and be
shown not to have dissuaded themselves from the
intended criminal act for which they shared the
common intention. Culpability under Section 34
cannot be excluded by mere distance from the scene of
occurrence. The presumption of constructive intention,http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 10
however, has to be arrived at only when the court can,
with judicial servitude, hold that the accused must have
preconceived the result that ensued in furtherance of the
common intention. A Division Bench of the Patna
High Court in Satrughan Patar v. Emperor (AIR 1919
Pat 111) held that it is only when a court with some
certainty holds that a particular accused must have
preconceived or premeditated the result which ensued
or acted in concert with others in order to bring about
that result, that Section 34 may be applied."
What then is the fact situation said to have been proved in the
present case ? It is in this context the factual score thus ought to
be noticed at this juncture.
On the factual score, it appears that 14 accused persons were
charged under Sections 302/149 and 307/34 IPC for committing
the murder of Bindeshwari Rai on 19th March, 1992 at 8.00 p.m.
All the 14 accused persons were held guilty for the murder by the
learned Sessions Judge : whereas accused Rajendra Rai, Uma
Shankar Rai, Sheo Bachan Rai, Shila Nath Rai, Dharm Nath Rai,
Satyendra Sahni alias Satyendra Kumar Sahni and Bankey Rai
have been convicted under Section 302 IPC and sentenced to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for life. All the 14 accused
persons, namely Rajendra Rai, Lallan Rai son of Rajendra Rai,
Uma Shankar Rai, Prithvi Rai, Ram Janam Rai, Sudarshan Rai,
Sheo Bachan Rai, Sipar Rai, Birendera Rai, Dharm Nath Rai,
Bankey Rai, Shila Nath Rai, Lallan Rai son of Bankey Rai and
Satyendra Sahni alias Satyendra Kumar Sahni have been held
guilty under Section 302/149 IPC and have been convicted
thereunder. Each of them has been sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for life under Section 302/149 IPC. All the
convicts are, however, presently on bail.
The convicts Uma Shankar Rai, Ram Janam Rai, Sudarshan
Rai, Prithvi Rai, Lallan Rai son of Rajendra Rai have been held
guilty under Section 307/34 IPC and they have been convicted
thereunder. Each of them has been sentenced to undergo R.I. for
five years under Section 307/34 IPC.
The High Court, however, on appeal on 10th May, 2000,
confirmed the conviction and sentences passed by the learned
Sessions Judge under Section 302 IPC against Rajendra Rai, Uma
Shankar Rai, Shila Nath Rai, Bankey Rai, Dharm Nath Rai and
Sheo Bachan Rai but passed an order for acquittal for the accused
Satyendra Sahni of the charge under Section 302 IPC.
As regards Uma Shankar Rai, Ram Janam Rai, Sudarshan
Rai, Prithvi Rai and Lallan Rai, the High Court also confirmed the
conviction and sentences under Section 307 read with Section 34
IPC. The High Court however, acquitted all the accused persons
convicted and sentenced under Section 302/149 IPC and hence the
appeal before this Court upon the grant of leave.
At this juncture, it would be convenient to advert to the
prosecution case briefly, so as to appreciate the contentions raised.
The case of the prosecution, as would appear from the fardbeyan of
Birendra Rai (PW.9), in short, is that on the day of Holi festival i.e.
19.3.1992 at about 8 p.m., he along with his brothers Bindeshwari
Rai , Ruplal Rai and Ram Dahin Rai was returning from Taraiya
Bazar. When they reached their village, they saw all the 14
accused persons sitting at the house of appellant Rajendra Rai
variously armed with weapons. It is alleged that on the instigation
of appellant Rajendra Rai, all the accused persons encircled the
informant and his companions. Thereafter appellant Rajendra Rai,
Satyendra Sahni and Uma Shankar Rai inflicted injuries with
sword on the head of Bindeshwari Rai. Thereupon, appellant
Shila Nath Rai also gave a sword blow on his head. Like thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 10
abovenamed appellants, other appellants Bankey Rai and Dharm
Nath Rai assaulted deceased Bindeshwari Rai with ’farsa’. When
Bindeshwari Rai became senseless while appellant Sheo Bachan
Rai caused injury with Bhala, the other accused persons caused
injuries with their respective weapons. The informant further
stated that when he wanted to save his brother, appellant Uma
Shankar Rai attacked him with sword but the blow was warded off.
When P.Ws. Ram Dahin and Ruplal tried to intervene, appellant
Lallan Rai son of Rajendra Rai fired his pistol causing injury to
Ruplal Rai. It has been further alleged that the accused persons
after committing the murder of Bindeshwari Rai, threw his body in
a maize field, which was situated adjoining north to the road. The
informant and the other witnesses have claimed to have identified
the accused persons in the moonlit night. On the basis of the
aforesaid statement, Officer Incharge of Taraiya Police Station
took up investigation and ultimately having found a prima facie
case, submitted charge sheet. Thereupon, the Chief Judicial
Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and committed the case
to the Court of Session calling upon the appellants to face trial.
The records depict that one Dr. Dharamnath Singh (PW.11)
held the post-mortem examination on the dead body of
Bindeshwari Rai and he found the following ante-mortem injuries
on the person of the body :
(i.) Multiple incised wounds about eight in number of varying
dimension on the scalp, more on left side than on the right
side, mid-portion.
(ii) Incised wound about 3" x " bone deep on the left cheek.
(iii) Incised wound about 1" x " skin deep on the back of the
neck.
(iv) Multiple bruises of varying dimension on the back of
chest wall on both sides.
(v) Penetrating wound about " in diameter muscle deep on
the right side on the back of waist.
(vi) Incised wound about 3" x 1" bone deep on the right side
of chin.
On dissection, there were multiple fractures of scalp bone,
laceration of underlying membranes and brain matter with
collection of clotted blood in immediate vicinity of the injured
parts. On further dissection fracture of the right side of ramus of
the mandible was disclosed. Rigor mortis was present on all the
limbs.
The doctor’s evidence reveals that the death of Bindeshwari
Rai was caused due to haemorrhage and shock as a result of
injuries to vital organs like brain and mandible caused by sharp
cutting weapon as also by sharp penetrating weapon such as Bhala.
The post-mortem examination was conducted within 24 hours.
Incidentally, there is nothing in the cross-examination of the
Doctor to discredit the evidence of the prosecution with regard to
the nature of injuries as also to the manner of assault.
It is on this state of the situation that Mr. PS Mishra, learned
Senior Advocate, appearing for the appellants with his usual
eloquence rather strongly contended that in view of the findings
recorded for charges under Section 302/149 IPC by the High Court
against which no appeal is preferred in this Court, it is clearly a
case where the appellants are supposed to have been convicted for
their individual acts and acts done in furtherance of the common
intention of all, which developed, if at all, in course of the assault
on Bindeshwari Rai. In the absence of any appeal against the said
acquittal for the offence under Section 302/149 IPC it will not be
legal to go by the evidence of existence of any pre-planning etc.
Though there is evidence that appellants who are convicted
under Section 302 IPC caused injury upon deceased Bindeshwari
Rai by lethal weapons on the head and various other parts of his
body, the medical evidence is clear that death was caused due to
haemorrhage and shock caused by the injuries to vital organs likehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 10
brain and also mandible caused by sharp-cutting weapons may be
Farsa and sword and also sharp cutting penetrating weapon such
as a Bhala.
In the absence of evidence as to who caused fatal injury or
which injury in particular was fatal, conviction under Section 302
IPC of as many as six appellants (one of whom who was charged
to have hit on the head of the victim by sword has been acquitted
by the High Court) is not sustainable at all.
It is well settled that culpable homicide is genus and murder
is the specie and that all murders are culpable homicide but not
vice-versa. A combined reading of the provisions in Chapter XVI
of the IPC with respect to offences affecting the human body and
the exceptions and illustrations would show that without
ascertaining as to who caused the death or that one of many
injuries inflicted by a certain person alone was the cause of death,
no one can be, much less a number of persons together, be
convicted for their acts under Section 302 IPC simpliciter. More
than one person together can be convicted only with the aid of
Section 149 IPC (if their number is more than five) or Section 34
IPC if they act in furtherance of common intention. Since the
appellants, however are acquitted under Section 302/149 IPC, the
High Court could not have convicted as many as six persons under
Section 302 IPC.
Mr. Mishra further contended that it is settled law that several
persons may have similar intention yet they may not have the
common intention in furtherance of which they participated in
action. Elaborate discussion of the principles and dominant
features for attracting Section 34 IPC are well discussed and
explained in one of the latest pronouncements of this Court in
Suresh (supra).
In para 44 of the judgment in Suresh (supra) this Court (the
majority view) stated:
"Approving the judgments of the Privy Council in
Barendra Kumar Ghosh [AIR 1925 PC 1] and
Mahbub Shah [AIR 1945 PC 118] cases a three-
Judge Bench of this Court in Pandurang v. State
of Hyderabad [AIR 1955 SC 216] held that to
attract the applicability of Section 34 of the Code
the prosecution is under an obligation to establish
that there existed a common intention which
requires a prearranged plan because before a man
can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act
of another, the act must have been done in
furtherance of the common intention of all. This
Court had in mind the ultimate act done in
furtherance of the common intention. In the
absence of a prearranged plan and thus a common
intention even if several persons simultaneously
attack a man and each one of them by having his
individual intention, namely, the intention to kill
and each can individually inflict a separate fatal
blow and yet none would have the common
intention required by the section. In a case like
that each would be individually liable for
whatever injury he caused but none could be
vicariously convicted for the act of any or the
other. The Court emphasised the sharing of the
common intention and not the individual acts of
the persons constituting the crime. Even at the
cost of repetition it has to be emphasised that for
proving the common intention it is necessary
either to have direct proof of prior concert or
proof of circumstances which necessarily lead to
that inference and "incriminating facts must be
incompatible with the innocence of the accusedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 6 of 10
and incapable of explanation or any other
reasonable hypothesis". Common intention,
arising at any time prior to the criminal act, as
contemplated under Section 34 of the Code, can
thus be proved by circumstantial evidence."
In Suresh (supra) this Court while recording the dominant
feature for attracting Section 34 has the following to state:
"The dominant feature for attracting Section
34 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred
to as "the Code") is the element of participation in
absence resulting in the ultimate "criminal act".
The "act" referred to in the later part of Section 34
means the ultimate criminal act with which the
accused is charged of sharing the common
intention. The accused is, therefore, made
responsible for the ultimate criminal act done by
several persons in furtherance of the common
intention of all. The section does not envisage the
separate act by all the accused persons for
becoming responsible for the ultimate criminal
act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the
purpose of Section 34 shall be rendered
infructuous."
For true and correct appreciation of legislative intent in the
matter of engrafting of Section 34 in the Statute Book, one needs
to have a look into the provision and as such Section 34 is set out
as below:
"34 - Acts done by several persons in
furtherance of common intention- when a
criminal act is done by several persons in
furtherance of the common intention of all, each
of such persons is liable for that act in the same
manner as if it were done by him alone."
A plain look at the Statute reveals that the essence of Section
34 is simultaneous consensus of the mind of persons participating
in the criminal action to bring about a particular result. It is trite
to record that such consensus can be developed at the spot. The
observations above obtain support from the decision of this Court
in Ramaswami Ayyangar & Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu [AIR
1976 SC 2027].
In the similar vein the Privy Council in (Barendra Kumar
Ghosh v. King Emperor [AIR 1925 PC 1: 26 Cri. LJ 431] stated
the true purport of Section 34 as below:
"The words of Section 34 are not to be eviscerated
by reading them in this exceedingly limited sense.
By Section 33 a criminal act in Section 34
includes a series of acts and, further, ’act’
includes omission to act, for example, an omission
to interfere in order to prevent a murder being
done before one’s very eyes. By Section 37,
when any offence is committed by means of
several acts whoever intentionally cooperates in
the commission of that offence by doing any one
of those acts, either singly or jointly with any
other person, commits that offence. Even if the
appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door,
it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other
things ’they also serve who only stand and wait.’"http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 7 of 10
The above discussion in fine thus culminates to the effect that
the requirement of statute is sharing the common intention upon
being present at the place of occurrence. Mere distancing himself
from the scene cannot absolve the accused though the same
however depends upon the fact-situation of the matter under
consideration and no rule steadfast can be laid down therefor.
Turning attention to the factual score, once again, be it
noticed that the High Court has rendered the submissions of the
defence as regards the witnesses being on inimical terms as totally
hypothetical guesswork de hors the realities and in justification
thereof stated "Simply because another passage was available for
the prosecution party to go to their houses, it would be difficult to
hold that they were not going through the road in question where
occurrence took place." Incidentally, the evidence of PW.7 Ram
Dahin Rai, PW.9 Birendra Rai and PW.10 Ruplal Rai, the
informant, stand out to be in full corroboration of the prosecution’s
case that no sooner Bindeshwari Rai and his companions arrived at
the place of occurrence, Rajendra Rai exhorted to kill and
thereafter assaulted him with sword. The High Court on
appreciation of the factual situation recorded the same and further
stated that Uma Shankar Rai also caused injury on the head of
Bindeshwari Rai by sword and when the latter fell down in a maize
field, Shila Nath Rai assaulted him with sword and Bankey Rai
with Farsa on his neck. It is on this score the High Court in fine
concludes as regards the appreciation of evidence to the effect:
"Thus in view of the consistent evidence of the injured eye
witness, there appears no reason to interfere with the findings of
the trial court so far it is with respect to those appellants who have
been convicted under Section 302 IPC."
The next issue seems to be rather important and we think it
expedient to quote paragraph 13 of the judgment impugned for its
proper appreciation :
"The next question, however, rises whether the
conviction and sentence against all the accused persons
under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC can
sustain. At the very outset it may be noticed although
the trial court has convicted these appellants under this
count but no finding has at all been recorded whether
the appellants were the members of unlawful assembly
and that such unlawful assembly had the knowledge
that the main accused persons had the common object
to commit the murder of Bindeshwari Rai. Because as
would appear from the case of the prosecution, the
accused persons were sitting at the Baithaka of
appellant Rajendra Rai and this was nothing unusual
since it was the day of Holi festival. This is not the
case of the prosecution that these accused persons had
the knowledge or any such information that deceased
Bindeshwari Rai and his companion would return from
Taraiya Bazar to the village through that very path and
at that very time. Rather the above fact would show
that the occurrence in case took place all of a sudden.
Unless and until there is any evidence of the
prosecution that all the accused persons had assembled
at the place of occurrence with a common object to
commit the murder of Bindeshwari Rai, it would not be
proper to hold them guilty under Section 302 read with
149 IPC. Therefore, the conviction against such
appellants can at best be recorded under Section
324/149 IPC. Because the evidence on record suggests
that it was the individual act of appellants Rajendra Rai,
Uma Shankar Rai, Shila Nath Rai, Bankey Rai, Dharm
Nath Rai and Shiv Bachan Rai, who had committed the
murder of Bindeshwari Rai with their respectivehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 8 of 10
weapons."
It is on the basis of the observations as above, the High Court
came to a finding that the appeal on behalf of the appellants
Rajendra Rai, Uma Shankar Rai, Shila Nath Rai, Bankey Rai,
Dharam Nath Rai and Sheo Bachan Rai ought to be dismissed and
their conviction and sentence under Section 302 of the Indian
Penal Code as recorded by the trial court stood confirmed.
As regards the case for appellants Uma Shankar Rai, Ram
Janam Rai, Sudarshan Rai, Prithvi Rai and Lallan Rai, the High
Court did place strong reliance on the evidence of the injured
witnesses ascribing them to be most acceptable and trustworthy
evidence and as such confirmed the sentence under Section 307
read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
It is the conviction under Section 302 which is said to be not
in accordance with law and as such Mr. Mishra has been rather
vocal and emphatic on that direction. It is axiomatic that
procedural law is the hand-maid of justice and the Code of
Criminal Procedure is no exception thereto. Its incorporation in
the Statute Book has been to sub-serve the ends of justice and non-
observance of the technicalities does not and cannot frustrate the
concept of justice since technicality alone would not out-weigh the
course of justice.
We, however, hasten to add that in the event, however, there
being prejudice leading to a failure of justice, it cannot but be
treated to be an illegality, which is otherwise incurable in nature.
In one of the early decisions of this Court (Willie (William)
Slaney v. The State of Madhya Pradesh - 1955 (2) SCR 1140), the
Full Bench declared and settled the law on this score and it seems
for all times to come. This Court in a recent decision (Kammari
Brahmaiah &Ors. v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P. JT
1999 (1) SC 259) once again reiterated the law so settled by Willie
Slaney (supra) in the similar vein and same tune. Incidentally,
Willie Slaney (supra) was decided in the year 1955 and on the
basis of the then existing Code of 1898, whereas Brahmaiah
(supra) has considered the new Code of 1973 and after
adumbrating the observations of Willie Slaney, this Court in
Brahmaiah observed :
"The aforesaid discussion leaves no doubt that
non-framing of charge would not vitiate the
conviction if no prejudice is caused thereby to the
accused. As observed in the aforesaid, the trial
should be fair to the accused, fair to the State and
fair to the vast mass of the people for whose
protection penal laws are made and administered.
Criminal Procedure Code is a procedural law and
is designed to further the ends of justice and not
to frustrate them by the introduction of endless
technicalities. In the present case, accused were
tried on the prosecution version that all of them
went at 3.30 p.m. in the field of the deceased; they
picked up the quarrel with him, inflicted injuries
to the deceased as narrated by the prosecution
witnesses, accused no.3 to 6 participated as stated
above; the statements were recorded under
Section 313 of the Cr.P.C. and the questions were
asked to the effect that they jointly came at 3.30
p.m. and caused injuries to the deceased as stated
by the prosecution witnesses and the role assigned
to accused no.3 to 6 was also specifically
mentioned. Hence, it is apparent that no prejudice
is caused to the accused who were charged for the
offence under Section 302, by not framing the
charge for the offence punishable under Section
302 read with 149. In this view of the matter, thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 9 of 10
conviction of the accused no.3 to 6 for the offence
punishable under Section 325 read with 149
cannot be said to be anyway illegal which require
to be set aside."
It is in this context Section 464 Cr.P.C. ought to be
noticed at this juncture. Section 464 Cr.P.C. reads thus :
"464. Effect of omission to frame, or absence
of, or error in, charge (1) No finding, sentence
or order by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall
be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no
charge was framed or on the ground of any error,
omission or irregularity in the charge including
any misjoinder of charges, unless in the opinion of
the Court of appeal, confirmation or revision, a
failure of justice has in fact been occasioned
thereby.
(2) If the Court of appeal, confirmation or
revision is of opinion that a failure of justice has
in fact been occasioned, it may
(a) in the case of an omission to frame a charge,
order that a charge be framed and that the trial be
recommenced from the point immediately after
the framing of the charge.
(b) in the case of an error, omission or
irregularity in the charge, direct a new trial to be
had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it
thinks fit;
Provided that if the Court is of opinion that
the facts of the case are such that no valid charge
could be preferred against the accused in respect
of the facts proved, it shall quash the conviction."
As regards the interpretation of Section 464 this Court has
the following to state in Kammari (supra) at paragraph 7:
"The aforesaid Section is in mandatory
terms and specifically provides what is to be
done in cases where charge is not framed or there
is an error, omission or irregularity in framing of
the charge. From the unequivocal terms of the
section, it can be stated that finding, sentence or
order could be set aside only in those cases where
the facts are such that no valid charge could be
preferred against the accused in respect of the
facts proved. Secondly, if the facts are such that
charge could be framed and yet it is not framed,
but there is no failure of justice, has in fact been
occasioned thereby the finding, sentence or order
of the Court of competent jurisdiction is not to be
set aside on that ground. Thirdly, if there is
failure of justice occasioned by not framing of the
charge or in case of an error, omission or
irregularity in charge re-trial of the case is to be
directed under sub-section (2)."
Incidentally, Section 464 corresponds to the provisions
contained in Sections 232(2), 535 and 537(6) of the old Code.
It is in this context the law laid down by this Court in
Kammari (supra) ought also to be noticed. This Court in paragraph
14 of the report stated as below:-
"14. The aforesaid discussion leaves no doubt that non-http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 10 of 10
framing of charge would not vitiate the conviction if no
prejudice is caused thereby to the accused. As observed in
the aforesaid, the trial should be fair to the accused, fair to
the State and fair to the vast mass of the people for whose
protection penal laws are made and administered. Criminal
Procedure Code is a procedural law and is designed to further
the ends of justice and not to frustrate them by the
introduction of endless technicalities."
Similar is the observation of this Court in Narinder Singh v.
State of Punjab (2000 (4) SCC 603) recording therein that if the
ingredients of the Section are present, conviction in regard thereto
can be sustained.
The evidence available on record in particular that of injured
eye witnesses, namely, PWs.7, 9 and 10 and the "Fardbayan"
which was recorded without any loss of time to the effect that all
the accused persons encircled the informant and other witnesses
and inflicted injuries on Bindeshwari Rai (deceased) by deadly
weapons resulting into his death it is trustworthy and acceptable
and question of decrying the evidentiary value thereof does not and
cannot arise, more so, having regard to the corroborative evidence
available on record by the doctor who conducted the post-mortem.
The entire gamut of the matter in issue leaves no manner of doubt
the concerted action by reason of simultaneous conscious mind of
persons participating in the action to bring about the death of
Bindeshwari Rai and it is this piece of evidence which brings in the
element of Section 34 even though no charge was framed
thereunder. This conviction and sentence under Section 302 of the
Indian Penal Code can be maintained by adding Section 34 of the
Indian Penal Code thereto that is to say under Section 302/34 of
the Indian Penal Code.
As regards the conviction under Section 307 of the Indian
Penal Code, be it noted that upon consideration of the injury report
as sustained by Ruplal Rai (PW.10), Ram Dahin Rai (PW.7) and
Birendra Rai (PW.9), the factum of causing grievous hurt though
established but conviction under Section 307/34 of the Indian
Penal Code in the interest of justice ought to be altered to under
Section 326/34 of the Indian Penal Code. It is ordered
accordingly. The sentence, however, be also altered to a period of
two years without however imposition of any fine.
The appeals thus stand disposed of in the manner indicated
