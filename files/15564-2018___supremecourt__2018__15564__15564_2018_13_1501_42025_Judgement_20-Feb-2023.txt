1JUDGMENT
KRISHNA MURARI, J.
1. These appeals are directed against the judgment and order dated
30.03.2018 passed by a Full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad
(hereinafter referred to as ‘the High Court’), The reference to Full Bench
came to be made under the following circumstances: -
1.1 Writ Petition No. 61449 of 2009, Smt. Madhuri Srivasatava Vs. State of
U.P. & Ors.1 along with other connected petitions were filed by certain
landholders whose land was acquired by NOIDA challenging the decision of the
Board of Directors of NOIDA dated 07.01.1998 as also the approval granted to
the said resolution by the State Government dated 02.03.2009 whereby a
distinction was carved out in the matter of payment of compensation by creating
a classification between “Pushtaini” and “Gair-pushtaini” landholders. The
‘Pushtaini’ landholders whose lands were acquired, were given additional
compensation @ Rs.3 per sq. yard along with 15% as rehabilitation bonus on
the compensation already awarded, as also the 10% area of the acquired land,
whereas those who were declared as ‘Gair-pusht xcaini’ were denied this
additional benefit. A Division Bench of the High Court vide Judgment and
order dated 10.05.2016 dismissed the Writ Petition holding the classification to
be reasonable having direct nexus with the object sought to be achieved i.e.,
rehabilitation of the original residents who are likely to become landless due to
the acquisition of their land.
2. Another bunch of Writ Petitions were filed by the present appellants
challenging a similar classification made by the Greater Noida Authority
1 (2016) 6 SCC OnLine AII 2832
2(hereinafter referred to as ‘G Noida’) in payment of compensation on the basis
of the landholder being ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’.
3. While considering the Writ Petitions, another Division Bench disagreed
with the views expressed in the case of Smt. Madhuri (Supra) and vide order
dated 07.07.2017 referred the matter to be decided by a larger Bench.
4. The Full Bench constituted in pursuance to the reference framed the
following questions for adjudication :-
(i) Whether the law laid down by a Division Bench of this Court in the
case of Smt. Madhuri Srivastava reported in (2016) 6 ADJ 1 is in
conflict to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of
Nagpur Improvement Trust and Another Vs. Vithal Rao and Ors.2 and
also with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894?
(ii) Whether the classification made under the U.P. Land Acquisition
(determination of compensation and declaration of award by agreement)
Rules, 1997, the distinction made among ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’
farmers, is a classification having reasonable nexus with the object
sought to be achieved?
5. Vide impugned judgment and order dated 30.03.2018, the Full Bench
answered question No. 1 in negative and question No. 2 in affirmative and
upheld the view taken by the Division Bench in the case of Smt. Madhuri
Srivastava (Supra). As a consequence of the answers to the questions framed,
2 (1973) 1 SCC 500
3the Full Bench held that nothing remains to be decided in the Writ Petitions
filed by the present appellants and the same were dismissed.
6. Before we enter into the factual matrix of the case, we find it expedient to
first trace out the etymology of the words “Pushtaini” and “Gair Pushtaini” used
in the impugned classification, for language, once adopted inside the realm of
law, materializes itself a much more powerful being, one which must be
understood in the right historical context.
7. The word ‘Pushtaini’ is a Persian word and finds its origin from the word
‘Pusht’, which means ‘back’. The said word has been historically used in the
context of ancestry. Any possession, tale or legend, that has roots to a particular
ancestry, to denote it’s significance to the said ancestry, the word ‘Pushtaini’ is
used. As is obvious, since the word ‘Gair’ which finds its origin in Urdu
language means ‘other than’, thus, ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ would mean one which is
not ‘Pushtaini’.
8. What we find most interesting however, is that ancestry as a concept,
especially before times of modern private property ownership, had remained to
be a tool for inclusivity and not exclusion. In such a context, the use of the word
“Pushtaini” by the Authority, to exclude compensation might be a historically
inaccurate interpretation. While this is not consequential to the merits of the
case, it is in our opinion a worthwhile observation, for law has to power to
legitimize the meaning of words and can change the context in which a word
used, and in turn can change the course of history itself.
4Background Facts
9. Since the early 1970s, Liberalization took over India by storm, and it
brought with it the promise of massive economic growth. A huge amount of
money was infused in the Indian Economy with the purpose of developing
Indian cities into massive global hubs of capital and business. In line with this,
Delhi began its journey of becoming a global city. This influx of capital into the
city also brought with it massive employment opportunities, and people from all
over the country started migrating to Delhi. To contain such influx of migrants
and ensure dignified living for all who came to the city with the hopes of
improving their lives, the government of India planned to develop residential
and industrial areas around the capital. For this, Gurgaon was developed across
the border of Haryana, and New Okhla Industrial Development Authority
(NOIDA) was developed by the Uttar Pradesh Government in the adjoining
district of Gautam Budh Nagar. In this period, the city enjoyed massive growth,
both in terms of influx of capital and migration. This growth was so
unprecedented, that it even exceeded the planning estimates as envisaged by the
authorities. As a measure to accommodate such growth, the Uttar Pradesh
Government, exercising its powers under Section 3 of the U.P. Industrial Area
Development Act, 1976, by notification dated 28.01.1991 created the township
of Greater Noida, in an area of 38000 hectare, comprising of 124 villages of
Gautam Budh Nagar.
10. For its planned development, the Respondent- G. Noida started
acquisition of land within its territorial area of operation under the provisions of
Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter referred to as ‘1894 Act’). In the same
connection, notifications dated 03.10.2005 and 05.01.2006 were issued under
5Sections 4(1) and Section 6(1) of 1894 Act for acquisition of total area of
580.1734 hectares of the land for plan development situate in different villages
falling within the jurisdiction of G. Noida. The said notifications, which also
included the land of the present appellants, were subject matter of challenge
before the High Court in a bunch of Writ Petitions challenging the acquisition
proceedings mainly on the ground of arbitrarily invoking urgency clause under
Sections 17(1) read with Section 17 (4) of the 1894 Act. The bunch of the said
Writ Petitions came to be decided by the another Full Bench of the High Court
titled as Gajraj Vs. State of U.P3. The High Court concluded that the urgency
clause was wrongly invoked, but saved the acquisition for the reason that much
development had already taken place over the said land and the nature of land
stands completely changed. The Full Bench further in order to compensate the
landholders directed an additional compensation to be paid to the landholders at
the rate of 64.70% of the already paid compensation and a further direction was
issued to allot developed Abadi land to the extent of 10% of their acquired land,
subject to a cap of Rs.2,500/- square meter. The Full Bench never made any
distinction between ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ farmers for payment of the
additional compensation or allotment of land. The Full Bench also relying upon
the decisions rendered in the case of Radheyshyam (Dead) through L.Rs &
Ors. Vs. State Of UP & Ors.4, Greater Noida Industrial Development
Authority Vs. Devendra Kumar & Ors.5, further held that merely because the
farmers had received compensation under an agreement, it cannot be said that
they have waived off the right to challenge the same. The Full Bench judgment
in Gajraj (Supra) came to be affirmed by this Court in Savitri Devi Vs. State of
U.P. & Ors.6
3 (2011) SCC OnLine AII 1711
4 (2011) 5 SCC 553
5 (2011) 12 SCC 375
6 (2015) 7 SCC 21
611. The present appellants had also filed a Writ Petition being Writ Petition
No. 62056 of 2011 challenged the notification issued under Sections 4 and 6
read with Section 17 of the Act. The said Writ Petition came to be disposed of
in terms of the directions issued by the Full Bench in the case of Gajraj (Supra)
vide judgment and order dated 01.11.2011.
12. It is also pertinent to mention at this stage that even before the land
acquisition proceedings were initiated and notification under Sections 4 and 6 of
the 1894 Act, were issued, the Respondent-Greater Noida in its 26th Board
meeting dated 28.10.1997 decided to classify the landholders for the purposes
of payment of compensation for acquisition of their land as ‘Pushtaini’, namely,
those landholders who had purchased the land prior to the date of establishment
of authority i.e., 28.01.1991 or thereafter got the land by partition or family
settlement and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ being those persons who purchased the land
after its establishment. Thus, two classes of landholders were carved out for
payment of compensation and those who were classified as ‘Pushtaini’
landholders, a higher amount of compensation was decided to be awarded to
them in the name of their rehabilitation.
13. Subsequently, on 15.07.2006, an agreement was entered into between
Greater Noida and the appellants and other landholders under Rule 4(2) of the
Land Acquisition Rules, 1997 (hereinafter referred to as ‘1997 Rules’) and in
accordance with the resolution passed by Greater Noida in its 26th Meeting, the
‘Pushtaini’ landholders were paid compensation @ Rs. 322 per sq. yard and the
‘Gair-Pushtaini’ landholders including the appellants herein were paid a lesser
amount of compensation @ Rs.280 per sq. yard.
714. The landholders continued with their agitation making demand of further
compensation at the enhanced rate which resulted in constituting a Committee
to consider the demand of enhanced rate of compensation in the form of
bonus/ex-gratia compensation. The Committee submitted its report after
making a recommendation for payment of the amount @ Rs.310 per square
metre on account of Ex-gratia to the Ancestral Agriculturists of the land situate
in 8 Villages.
15. The report of the Committee dated 25.10.2008 is being reproduced
hereunder for a ready reference :-

Level of Authority.

learned District Magistrate has revealed the facts in detail in

by the Agriculturists. The Committee has perused the
recommendation dated 21.07.2008 of the Committee
constituted under the chairmanship of the learned District
Magistrate, Gautam Buddha Nagar. Such finding has been
concluded in its report dated 21.07.2008 that it is not possible
to make any change in the rate of compensation in
accordance with law, because of receiving the compensation
after fulfillment of the agreement under the Agreement
Regulation after acquisition of the land by the concerned
Agriculturists, but, the Committee has recommended in its
report dated 21.07.2008 to award certain amount in the
detailed circumstances on account of ex-gratia.

per the Government Order dated 29.09.2001, under the
provisions of Uttar Pradesh Land Acquisition (Determination
of Compensation and Declaration of Award by Agreement)
Rules, 1997, have received Compensation. Therefore, it
would not be possible under the rule to make any
enhancement/ change in the compensation rates of the award
to be declared. Accordingly, it would be appropriated only to
give additional amount on account of Ex gratia to be
awarded as relief to the Agriculturists of these Villages. In the
report dated 21.07.2008 of the Committee constituted under
14the chairmanship of the learned District Magistrate,
recommendation has been given to award additional amount
@ Rs.175-200 per square metre. But, in opinion of the
Committee, there is justification to make partial enhancement
in above amount.

consultation, discussion, consideration made from the
Agriculturists and assurance given at the level of Authority,
this Committee is hereby made recommendation to make

ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE APPELLANTS
20. The learned Counsel for the Appellants Contended that:-
I. Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act does not allow for a
discrimination between Pushtaini and Gair-pushtaini landowners in
determination of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act.
19I. In light of the law laid down by this Court in the Nagpur Improvement
Trust Case (Supra), no distinction between the abovementioned two sets
of classes of landowners can be made on the basis of the date of purchase
of the land and the date of establishment of G NOIDA. The Ld. Counsel
argued that all the landowners whose land was acquired should stand on
the same pedestal.
II. The Land of both the classes of landowners have been acquired under the
same procedure, for the same public purpose and having the same market
value, and hence, any difference in the rate of compensation provided to
any party is highly discriminatory and is violative of Article 14.
III.Further, it has also been argued that merely by signing the agreement, the
Appellants herein cannot be said to have waived their right to Appeal the
compensation, especially since the fact that the ex-gratia payment
granted to the Pushtaini landowners was awarded after the agreement
was signed.
IV. It has also been contended that the ex-gratia payment as a form of
compensation does not exist in the Land Acquisition Act, and can only be
interpreted as one of the reasons for payment within Section 23 of the
Land Acquisition Act, and in such a scenario, the payment must be
universally made to all parties.
20ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY THE RESPONDENTS
21. The Ld. Counsel for the Respondents Contended that:
I. The UP Land Acquisition Rules have been formed under the Land
Acquisition Act,1894. These rules prescribe for method of compensation
between the acquirer and the acquiree through an agreement. The
Appellants, by way of an agreement, voluntarily accepted the
compensation being granted to them. Further, while accepting the
compensation, the Appellants herein also submitted an Affidavit stating
that the compensation is agreed upon and accepted by the parties. It was
only three years later that the Appellants decided to file a writ
challenging the compensation, after entering into the agreement and
explicitly agreeing to the compensation amount.
II. The Appellants had entered into an agreement as per the law of the land
and had accepted the compensation granted to them. In such a scenario,
there exists no legal remedy of the Appellants to re-open the agreement
on grounds of a subsequent increase in compensation to a different party.
There is no remedy to re-open the agreement by way of approaching the
Court in the statue.
III.The distinction created between the two classes of land owners has been
done on the basis of their residence. The base compensation given to
21both the classes is the same, and only an additional 15% extra amount is
given to Pushtaini landowners as rehabilitation bonus, which is not a
necessity for the Gair-pushtaini landowners as they do not reside in the
concerned land and are not sons of the soil.
IV. As regards to the ex-gratia payment given to the Pushtaini landowners,
the same is merely an additional compensation based on the
classification between sons of the soils and mere investors in the land.
The payment is based on reasonable classification and is not violative of
Article 14.
Issues
22. In the aftermath of the aforesaid litigations in the High Court, the
following three questions arise for adjudication in these Appeals :-
I. Whether the Appellants, by signing the agreement,have waived their right
to seek for revised compensation?
II. Whether the classification made under the Land Acquisition Act, and the
UP Land Acquisition Rules,1997 between Pushtaini Landowners and
Gair-pushtaini Landowners for the payment of compensation at different
22rates is liable to be struck down as violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution?
III. Whether the classification made by the Full-Bench of the High Court
between Pushtaini landowners and Gair-pushtaini landowners is in
contravention to the law laid down by this Hon’ble Court in the case of
Nagpur Improvement Trust and Another vs. Vithal Rao and Others (1973)
1 SCC 500?
23. We have heard, Shri Pradeep Kant, Learned Senior Counsel for the
appellants, Shri. Ravindra Kumar, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
Greater Noida and Shri Ravindra Kumar Raizada, learned counsel for the State
of U.P./A.A.G., at great length.
24. At the outset, we would like to clarify that in the present appeals, we are
only concerned with the legality and validity of action of G. Noida paying an
enhanced compensation to the landholders by carving out an artificial class of
‘Pushtaini’ landholders from among the same class of landholders whose land
was acquired by the same notification for the same purpose. There is no
challenge to the validity of the acquisition itself as the same stands finally
settled by this Court.
23Analysis
Whether the Appellants are bound by the compensation as per the
agreement under the Land Acquisition rules, and have waived off
their right to seek enhanced compensation?
25. It has been vehemently submitted on behalf of Greater Noida that the
appellants herein did not exhaust their remedy under Section 18 of the Land
Acquisition Act and approach the High Court, and has sidestepped a procedural
requirement. Section 18 of the 1894 Act reads as under :-
“Reference to Court.- (1) Any person interested who has not
accepted the award may, by written application to the
Collector, require that the matter be referred by the Collector
for the determination of the Court, whether his objection be
to the measurement of the land, the amount of the
compensation, the persons to whom it is payable, or the
apportionment of the compensation among the persons
interested.
(2) The application shall state the grounds on which
objection to the award is taken: Provided that every such
application shall be made,
(a) if the person making it was present or represented before
the Collector at the time when he made his award, within six
weeks from the date of the Collector's award;
(b) in other cases, within six weeks of the receipt of the
notice from the Collector under section 12, sub-section (2),
or within six months from the date of the Collector's award,
whichever period shall first expire.”
2426. The first and foremost thing to be taken note of is that the nature of the
challenge in the Writ Petition filed by the appellants before the High Court was
based on violation of Article 14, which is a fundamental right enshrined in the
Constitution. Such a challenge, irrespective of the existence of any alternative
remedy under a statute cannot put a bar on the jurisdiction of the Constitutional
Courts.
27. The Respondent Authority argued that since the agreement was
consented to, no challenge could exist in the Court. This argument in the facts
of the case, has been raised only to be rejected. The issue involved in
adjudication is not in respect of an agreement entered into by the appellants.
Similar agreements were also entered into with the Authority by such identically
situated landholders who have been granted additional compensation
subsequent to the agreement by carving out a distinction on the basis of period
of residence/occupation of the land which was acquired by creating an artificial
classification of ‘Pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-Pushtaini’ landholders.
28. Furthermore, since the issue of additional compensation by making an
artificial classification of ‘pushtaini’ and ‘Gair-pushtani’ was not in existence at
the time of the agreement, there was no occasion to challenge the same.
2529. Further, specifically in the context of the grant of ex-gratia payment, it is
to be noted that the said payment granted to Pushtaini landowners through a
separate notification, was assessed, and given, after the agreement was signed
by both, Pushtaini and Gair-pushtaini Landowners. The Appellants herein, under
those circumstances, could not have challenged the agreement vis a vis the ex-
gratia payment on grounds of violation of Article 14, when no such violation
existed at the time of the agreement. No man can be expected to predict a future
violation of their rights and file a pre-emptive appeal. This Court is reminded of
the words of Francis Bacon, who in the 17th century wrote about the link
between legal certainty and justice:
“For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall
prepare himself to the battle? So if the law give an uncertain
sound, who shall prepare to obey it? It ought therefore to
warn before it strikes... Let there be no authority to shed
blood; nor let sentence be pronounced in any Court upon
cases, except according to a known and certain law Nor
should a man be deprived of his life, who did not first know
that he was risking it.' (Quoted in Coquillette, Francis
Bacon pp 244 and 248, from Aphorism 8 and Aphorism 39?
A Treatise on Universal Justice).”
30. On the basis of the above-mentioned reasons, we are of the considered
opinion that the Appellants, because of their signing of the agreement, have not
forfeited their right to seek revised compensation, because ,the cause of action
26accrued to them much after entering into the agreement. The issue no. 1 is
answered accordingly in the negative and in favour of the Appellants.
Whether the classification made by and executive fiat between Pushtaini
Landowners and Gair-pushtaini Landowners for payment of compensation
at different rates is liable to be struck down as violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution?
31. The High Court, while upholding the classification between ‘Pushtaini’
and ‘Gair-pushtaini’ landowners, stated that there is no discrimination being
caused to similarly situated parties, and the judgment rendered by the Division
Bench in the case of Smt. Madhuri Srivastava (Supra) lays down the correct
law. Thus, the Full Bench upheld the classification and negated the challenge
made to the said classification. The relevant paragraphs of the impugned
judgment are reproduced hereunder :-
“Before coming on merits of the case, it would be
appropriate to state that sovereign power of state to acquire
private property for public purpose is based upon maxim
"salus populi est suprema lax" means welfare of the public is
paramount law and maxim "necessita publica major est
quam privata" means public necessity is greater than
private. The maxim "eminent domain" (sabai bhumi Govind
Ki) means state is supreme owner of the land. Constitution
of India incorporates these maxims. Acquisition of private
property can be made by legislation, exercising powers
under Articles 245 and 246 of the Constitution. Subject
"acquisition and requisition of property for the purposes of
27the Union" was mentioned as Entry No. 33 of List-I and
"acquisition and requisition of property except for the
purposes of the Union" was mentioned as Entry No. 36 of
List-II of the Seventh Schedule of Constitution. By Section 26
of Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act, 1956, Entry No.
33 of List-I and Entry No. 36 of List-II were deleted and
Entry No. 42 of List-III of Seventh Schedule of the
Constitution was amended as "acquisition and requisition of
property". Acquisition of private parties can be made by
exercise of executive power under Article 298 of
Constitution. Union of India and State Governments can
acquire private property, exercising legislative or executive
powers.
While dealing with an issue pertaining to classification and
its reasonability, we must also keep in mind that the
governance is not a simple thing. It encounters and deals
with the problems which come from persons in an infinite
variety of relations. Classification is the recognition of those
relations, and, in making it a wide latitude of discretion and
judgment must be given.
Having considered all aspects of the matter by keeping in
mind the Constitutional provisions discussed above and also
the intent of the Act, 1894 especially the provisions of
Sections 23 and 24 of the Act, 1894, we are of considered
opinion that the classification introduced among the
Pushtaini and Gair-pushtaini farmers is reasonable with
intelligible differentia and that in no manner causes any
discrimination among the similarly situated person. The law
laid down in the case of Smt. Madhuri Srivastava (supra)
has taken adequate care of all these provisions while
concluding that the Pushtaini and Gairpushtaini farmers are
two different classes and the resolution to award additional
compensation on different rates is not at all discriminatory.”
32. To assess the validity of the impugned classification, we must put it
through the rigours of Article 14 and see whether it survives the baptism. It is a
28well established principle of law, that the state, as per Article 14, cannot deny
equality before law and equal protection of the law.
REASONABLE CLASSIFICATION TEST
33. For any classification to survive the test of Article 14, the classification
must be based on intelligible differentia, and it must have a rational nexus to the
object sought to be achieved by the law. At this stage, it is important to note that
the object sought to be achieved must also be lawful, and if the object of the law
itself is found to be discriminatory, then such discrimination must be struck
down. This has been held in a catena of judgments.
34. The reasonable classification test was first introduced to Indian
Jurisprudence in the case of State Of West Bengal Vs. Anwar Ali Sarkar7 . The
issue raised therein was against the Bengal Special Courts Act which was
enacted for the purpose of speedier trial of certain offences. This Act was
challenged on the touchstone of Article 14 on grounds of the Act giving
arbitrary powers to the state government. The Court, while dismissing the
appeal of the state held that:-
7 (1952) AIR 75
29“It can be taken to be well settled that the principle
underlying the guarantee in Article 14 is not that the same
rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the
Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made
available to them irrespective of differences of
circumstances [Charanjit Lal Chowdhury v. Union of India,
1950 SCR 869 : 1950 SCC 833] . It only means that all
persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both
in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed [Old
Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram Distillers Corpn., 81
L Ed 109 : 299 US 183 (1936) : 1936 SCC OnLine US SC
145] . Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the
same situation, and there should be no discrimination
between one person and another if as regards the
subjectmatter of the legislation their position is
substantially the same. This brings in the question of
classification. As there is no infringement of the equal
protection rule, if the law deals alike with all of a certain
class, the legislature has the undoubted right of classifying
persons and placing those whose conditions are
substantially similar under the same rule of law, while
applying different rules to persons differently situated. It is
said that the entire problem under the equal protection
clause is one of classification or of drawing lines [ Dowling
: Cases on Constitutional Law, 4th Edn. 1139.]. In making
the classification the legislature cannot certainly be
expected to provide “abstract symmetry”. It can make and
set apart the classes according to the needs and exigencies
of the society and as suggested by experience. It can
recognise even “degrees of evil” [Skinner v. Oklahoma, 86
L Ed 1655 : 316 US 535 at p. 540 (1942) : 1942 SCC
OnLine US SC 125] , but the classification should never be
arbitrary, artificial or evasive. It must rest always upon real
and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just
relation to the thing in respect to which the classification is
made; and classification made without any reasonable basis
should be regarded as invalid [Southern Railway Co. v.
Greene, 54 L Ed 536 : 216 US 400 at p. 412 (1910) : 1910
SCC OnLine US SC 59] . These propositions have not been
controverted before us and it is not disputed also on behalf
of the respondents that the presumption is always in favour
30of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is
upon him who attacks it, to show that there has been
transgression of constitutional principles.
I am not at all impressed by the argument of the learned
Attorney General that to enable the respondents to invoke
the protection of Article 14 of the Constitution it has got to
be shown that the legislation complained of is a piece of
“hostile” legislation. The expressions “discriminatory” and
“hostile” are found to be used by American Judges often
simultaneously and almost as synonymous expressions in
connection with discussions on the equal protection clause.
If a legislation is discriminatory and discriminates one
person or class of persons against others similarly situated
and denies to the former the privileges that are enjoyed by
the latter, it cannot but be regarded as “hostile” in the sense
that it affects injuriously the interests of that person or
class. Of course, if one's interests are not at all affected by a
particular piece of legislation, he may have no right to
complain. But if it is established that the person
complaining has been discriminated against as a result of
legislation and denied equal privileges with others
occupying the same position, I do not think that it is
incumbent upon him, before he can claim relief on the basis
of his fundamental rights, to assert and prove that in making
the law, the legislature was actuated by a hostile or inimical
intention against a particular person or class. For the same
reason I cannot agree with the learned Attorney General
that in cases like these, we should enquire as to what was
the dominant intention of the legislature in enacting the law
and that the operation of Article 14 would be excluded if it
is proved that the legislature had no intention to
discriminate, though discrimination was the necessary
consequence of the Act. When discrimination is alleged
against officials in carrying out the law, a question of
intention may be material in ascertaining whether the
officer acted mala fide or not [Sunday Lake Iron Co. v.
Wakefield, 62 L Ed 1154 : 247 US 350 (1918) : 1918 SCC
OnLine US SC 148] ; but no question of intention can arise
when discrimination follows or arises on the express terms
of the law itself .”
3135. In the case of Rustom Cavasjee Cooper (Banks Nationalisation) v.
Union of India8, R.C.Cooper, who was the director of Central Bank of India
filed a petition against the Union of India challenging the provisions of The
Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Ordinance,
1969. The Court while deciding this case held that it cannot overlook the
violation of fundamental rights of the citizens on mere technicalities. It then
further went on to state that the Courts won’t look into the objects of the
impugned act and rather they will look into the effect of the impugned act. The
Court found the said Act in clear violation of Article 14 since only 14
banks were restrained from conducting banking business in the future
while other banks including foreign banks were allowed to continue Banking in
India. It has been observed in the said case as under :-
“By article 14 of the Constitution the State is enjoined not
to deny to any person equality before the law or the equal
protection of the laws within the territory of India. The
Article forbids class legislation, but not reasonable
classification in making laws. The test of permissible
classification under an Act lies in two cumulative
conditions: (1) classification under the Act must be founded
on an intelligible differentia distinguishing persons,
transactions or things grouped together from others left out
of the group; (ii) the differential has a rational relation to
the object sought to be achieved by the Act: there must be a
nexus between the basis of classification and the object of
the Act.
8 (1970) 1 SCC 248
32The legislative policy as to the necessity is a matter of
legislative judgment and the Court will not examine the
propriety of it. The legislation need not be all embracing
and it is for the Legislature to determine what categories
will be embraced. In Dalmia case (Ram Krishna Dalmia v.
S.R. Tendolkar, 1959 SCR 279) it was said that the two tests
of classification were first that there should be an
intelligible differentia which distinguished persons or
things grouped from others left out and secondly the
differentia must have a rational relation to the object
sought to be achieved by the statute”
36. Most recently, a Constitution Bench of this Court in the case of Navtej
Singh Johar & Ors. Vs. Union of India Thr. Secretary, Ministry of Law and
Justice9, while considering the question of scrapping Section 377, IPC as
violative of Article 14 has detailed out the test of reasonable classification under
Article 14 as under :-
“We, first, must test the validity of Section 377 IPC on the
anvil of Article 14 of the Constitution. What Article 14
propounds is that “all like should be treated alike”. In other
words, it implies equal treatment for all equals. Though the
legislature is fully empowered to enact laws applicable to a
particular class, as in the case at hand in which Section 377
applies to citizens who indulge in carnal intercourse, yet the
classification, including the one made under Section 377
IPC, has to satisfy the twin conditions to the effect that the
classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia
and the said differentia must have a rational nexus with the
object sought to be achieved by the provision, that is,
Section 377 IPC.
Section 377 has consigned a group of citizens to the
margins. It has been destructive of their identities. By
imposing the sanctions of the law on consenting adults
involved in a sexual relationship, it has lent the authority of
9 (2018) 10 SCC 1
33the State to perpetuate social stereotypes and encourage
discrimination. Gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgenders
have been relegated to the anguish of closeted identities.
Sexual orientation has become a target for exploitation, if
not blackmail, in a networked and digital age. The impact of
Section 377 has travelled far beyond the punishment of an
offence. It has been destructive of an identity which is
crucial to a dignified existence”
37. In the case at hand, it has been held by the Full Bench of the High Court
that the classification between Pushtaini and Gair-pushtaini Landowners is
based on one class of landowners being sons of the soil, while the other class
being mere landowners, who are not directly attached to the land. Further, the
object of this classification, as stated by the full bench of the High Court, is to
rehabilitate the original residents, i.e the sons of the soil, who are likely to
become landless due to the acquisition of their land.
38. While prima facie, the classification and the object sought to be achieved
through the said classification seems reasonable, however, the devil lies in the
details. The justification given by the GNOIDA Authority, and the Full-bench of
the High Court assumes that only Pushtaini landowners permanently reside in
the subject land or that the subject land is the primary source of income only for
Pushtaini landowners, and this assumption has been backed by no empirical
data produced by the authority.
3439.While the classification made by Greater Noida has been based on the object
of giving fair compensation, however, such a laudable object of the
classification would stand breached by the effects of such a classification,
creating a dissonance between the object and its effect. Many Gair-pushtaini
landholders, whose main area of residence or their main source of income is
also the subject land, would be subject to great discrimination and injustice, if
the same compensation that has been granted to the pushtaini landholders is not
extended to them.
40. Further, it is also to be noted that this Court at this stage cannot enter into
a fact finding mission to verify the claims of the respondent authority. To justify
such a classification, the respondent authority should have discharged their
burden of proof to back their claim. Mere statements without any evidence
cannot be accepted by us as justification for the said classification, which can
have a debilitating effect on those who are at the losing side of the
classification.
41. To survive the rigors of Article 14, the impugned classification must not
only make it through the abovementioned test, but also clear the Wednesbury
Principle, and by extension the Proportionality test.
35WEDNESBURY PRINCIPLE
42. In the case of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Limited v.
Wednesbury Corporation10, the King’s Bench Division was tasked with the
question of under what circumstances can the Court interfere in cases of
administrative law making. While dealing with this, the Court held that
interference in administrative decisions was permissible, only if (i) the order
was contrary to law (ii) or relevant factors were not considered, or (iii)
irrelevant factors were considered or, (iv) or the decision was such that no other
authority under similar circumstances would have come to this conclusion. The
relevant paragraph of the judgment are reproduced herein:
“In the result, this appeal must be dismissed. I do not wish
to repeat myself but I will summarize once again the
principle applicable. The Court is entitled to investigate the
action of the local authority with a view to seeing whether
they have taken into account matters which they ought not to
take into account, or, conversely, have refused to take into
account or neglected to take into account matters which they
ought to take into account. Once that question is answered
in favour of the local authority, it may be still possible to say
that, although the local authority have kept within the four
corners of the matters which they ought to consider, they
have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that
no reasonable authority could ever have come to it. In such
a case, again, I think the Court can interfere.
The power of the Court to interfere in each case is not as an
appellate authority to override a decision of the local
authority, but as a judicial authority which is concerned,
and concerned only, to see whether the local authority have
10 [1948] 1 KB 223
36contravened the law by acting in excess of the powers which
Parliament has confided in them. The appeal must be
dismissed with costs.”
43. The Wednesbury principle was first introduced to Indian Jurisprudence in
the case of Om Kumar & Ors. Vs. Union Of India11. Here, again, a similar
question was posed before the Supreme Court, as to when can the Court
exercise its power of judicial review in cases of executive law making. This
Court, reiterated the same principles laid down in the Wednesbury case. The
relevant extracts from the said judgment is reproduced hereunder:-
“Lord Greene said in 1948 in the Wednesbury case [(1948)
1 KB 223 : (1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA)] that when a statute
gave discretion to an administrator to take a decision, the
scope of judicial review would remain limited. He said that
interference was not permissible unless one or the other of
the following conditions was satisfied, namely the order was
contrary to law, or relevant factors were not considered, or
irrelevant factors were considered; or the decision was one
which no reasonable person could have taken. These
principles were consistently followed in the UK and in India
to judge the validity of administrative action.”
44. The classification made by GNOIDA does not find its footing in the Land
Acquisition Act, or the UP-Land Acquisition Rules, and hence is contrary to
law. The said classification also suffers from not taking into account relevant
considerations. The Authority, without taking into account any empirical data,
11 (2001) 2 SCC 386
37or calculating any possibility of Gair-pushtaini landowners being rendered
landless or without a primary source of income, made the impugned
classification. These relevant factors, by not being taken into account, can and
would cause great injustice to Gair-pushtaini landowners.
45. Further, GNOIDA, by arbitrarily classifying the landowners as Pushtaini
and Gair-pushtaini on the basis of a cut-off date, have taken into account an
irrelevant factor. The cut-off date by itself, without any context of the
landowners on ground, is not indicative of who the most adversely affected
landowners are. By not complying with these three factors while making the
classification, this Court must strike down such a classification.
46. While the Wednesbury principle has been used as a guiding principle of
interpretation, the Indian Court have now adopted a much more rigorous test,
i.e., is proportionality test, to see whether an administrative action can survive
the rigours of Article 14.
PROPORTIONALITY TEST
47. In the case of Om Kumar (Supra), this Court held that the administrative
measure must not be more drastic than is necessary for attaining the desired
38result. This was the first formal introduction of the Proportionality test to Indian
Jurisprudence, however the Court pointed out that the proportionality test has
been used by the Indian Courts even before this judgment. The relevant
paragraphs from the said report reads as under :-
“27.The principle originated in Prussia in the nineteenth
century and has since been adopted in Germany, France and
other European countries. The European Court of Justice at
Luxembourg and the European Court of Human Rights at
Strasbourg have applied the principle while judging the
validity of administrative action. But even long before that,
the Indian Supreme Court has applied the principle of
“proportionality” to legislative action since 1950, as stated
in detail below.
28. By “proportionality”, we mean the question whether,
while regulating exercise of fundamental rights, the
appropriate or least-restrictive choice of measures has been
made by the legislature or the administrator so as to achieve
the object of the legislation or the purpose of the
administrative order, as the case may be. Under the
principle, the Court will see that the legislature and the
administrative authority “maintain a proper balance
between the adverse effects which the legislation or the
administrative order may have on the rights, liberties or
interests of persons keeping in mind the purpose which they
were intended to serve”. The legislature and the
administrative authority are, however, given an area of
discretion or a range of choices but as to whether the choice
made infringes the rights excessively or not is for the Court.
That is what is meant by proportionality.
29.The above principle of proportionality has been applied
by the European Court to protect the rights guaranteed
under the European Convention for the Protection of Human
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950 and in particular,
39for considering whether restrictions imposed were
restrictions which were “necessary” — within Articles 8 to
11 of the said Convention [corresponding to our Article
19(1)] and to find out whether the restrictions imposed on
fundamental freedoms were more excessive than required.
(Handyside v. UK [(1976) 1 EHR 737] ). Articles 2 and 5 of
the Convention contain provisions similar to Article 21 of
our Constitution relating to life and liberty. The European
Court has applied the principle of proportionality also to
questions of discrimination under Article 14 of the
Convention (corresponding to Article 14 of our
Constitution). (See European Administrative Law by J.
Schwarze, 1992, pp. 677-866).
30. On account of a Chapter on Fundamental Rights in Part
III of our Constitution right from 1950, Indian Courts did
not suffer from the disability similar to the one experienced
by English Courts for declaring as unconstitutional
legislation on the principle of proportionality or reading
them in a manner consistent with the charter of rights. Ever
since 1950, the principle of “proportionality” has indeed
been applied vigorously to legislative (and administrative)
action in India. While dealing with the validity of legislation
infringing fundamental freedoms enumerated in Article
19(1) of the Constitution of India — such as freedom of
speech and expression, freedom to assemble peaceably,
freedom to form associations and unions, freedom to move
freely throughout the territory of India, freedom to reside
and settle in any part of India, — this Court has occasion to
consider whether the restrictions imposed by legislation
were disproportionate to the situation and were not the least
restrictive of the choices. The burden of proof to show that
the restriction was reasonable lay on the State. “Reasonable
restrictions” under Articles 19(2) to (6) could be imposed on
these freedoms only by legislation and Courts had occasion
throughout to consider the proportionality of the restrictions.
In numerous judgments of this Court, the extent to which
“reasonable restrictions” could be imposed was considered.
In Chintamanrao v. State of M.P. [1950 SCC 695 : AIR 1951
SC 118 : 1950 SCR 759] Mahajan, J. (as he then was)
observed that “reasonable restrictions” which the State
40could impose on the fundamental rights “should not be
arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required
in the interests of the public”.
31. “Reasonable” implied intelligent care and deliberations,
that is, the choice of a course which reason dictated.
Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invaded the
right could not be said to contain the quality of
reasonableness unless it struck a proper balance between
the rights guaranteed and the control permissible under
Articles 19(2) to (6). Otherwise, it must be held to be
wanting in that quality. Patanjali Sastri, C.J. in State of
Madras v. V.G. Row [(1952) 1 SCC 410 : AIR 1952 SC 196 :
1952 SCR 597 : 1952 Cri LJ 966] , observed that the Court
must keep in mind the “nature of the right alleged to have
been infringed, the underlying purpose of the restrictions
imposed, the extent and urgency of the evil sought to be
remedied thereby, the disproportion of the imposition, the
prevailing conditions at the time”. This principle of
proportionality vis-àvis legislation was referred to by Jeevan
Reddy, J. in State of A.P. v. McDowell & Co. [(1996) 3 SCC
709] recently. This level of scrutiny has been a common
feature in the High Court and the Supreme Court in the last
fifty years. Decided cases run into thousands.
32. So far as Article 14 is concerned, the Courts in India
examined whether the classification was based on
intelligible differentia and whether the differentia had a
reasonable nexus with the object of the legislation.
Obviously, when the Courts considered the question whether
the classification was based on intelligible differentia, the
Courts were examining the validity of the differences and the
adequacy of the differences. This is again nothing but the
principle of proportionality. There are also cases where
legislation or rules have been struck down as being
arbitrary in the sense of being unreasonable [see Air India v.
Nergesh Meerza [(1981) 4 SCC 335 : 1981 SCC (L&S) 599]
(SCC at pp. 372-373)]. But this latter aspect of striking
down legislation only on the basis of “arbitrariness” has
been doubted in State of A.P. v. McDowell and Co. [(1996) 3
SCC 709] .
4133. In Australia and Canada, the principle of proportionality
has been applied to test the validity of statutes [see Cunliffe
v. Commonwealth [(1994) 58 Aust LJ 791] Aust LJ (at 827,
839) (799, 810, 821)]. In R. v. Oakes [(1986) 26 DLR (4th)
200] Dickson, C.J. of the Canadian Supreme Court has
observed that there are three important components of the
proportionality test. First, the measures adopted must be
carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They
must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational
considerations. In short, they must be rationally connected
to the objective. Secondly, the means, must not only be
rationally connected to the objective in the first sense, but
should impair as little as possible the right to freedom in
question. Thirdly, there must be “proportionality” between
the effects of the measures and the objective. See also Ross v.
Brunswick School Dishut No. 15 [(1996) 1 SCR 825] (SCR
at p. 872) referring to proportionality. English Courts had
no occasion to apply this principle to legislation. The
aggrieved parties had to go to the European Court at
Strasbourg for a declaration.
34. In U.S.A., in City of Boerne v. Flores [(1997) 521 US
507] the principle of proportionality has been applied to
legislation by stating that “there must be congruence and
proportionality between the injury to be prevented or
remedied and the means adopted to that end”.
35. Thus, the principle that legislation relating to
restrictions on fundamental freedoms could be tested on the
anvil of “proportionality” has never been doubted in India.
This is called “primary” review by the Courts of the validity
of legislation which offended fundamental freedoms.
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
45. Under Article 3(1) of the Human Rights Act, 1998 the
English Court can now declare the legislative action as
incompatible with the rights and freedoms referred to in the
schedule. The Minister is then to move Parliament for
necessary amendment to remove the incompatibility. While
doing so, the English Court, can now apply strict scrutiny or
proportionality to legislative and administrative action. The
42principle is now treated as central to English law (See
Human Rights Law and Practice by Lord Lester of Herne
Hill, Q.C. & David Pannick QC, 1999, para 3.16). The more
the threshold of Wednesbury irrationality is lowered when
fundamental human rights are on play, the easier it will
become to establish judicial review as an effective remedy
with Article 13 of the 1998 Act (see, ibid, Supplement
August, 2000, para 4.13.12).
48. This test of proportionality has been developed by the Indian Courts
throughout the years and has now attained the form of a five-pronged test, as
stated in the K. S. Puttaswamy & Anr. Vs. Union of India & Ors.12 judgment,
and more recently, in the Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha & Anr. Vs. State of
Gujarat13.
49. In K.S.Puttaswamy(Supra), a nine-Judge Bench of this Court while
deciding the question as to whether the Constitution of India guarantees to each
individual a fundamental right to privacy, expounded the ‘principle of
proportionality and legitimacy’ in relation to infringement of rights as a result of
State measures. It was held that proportionality is essential for protection from
arbitrary State action as it ensures that the nature and quality of the
encroachment on the right is in proportion to the purpose of law. While
12 (2017) 10 SCC 1
13 (2020) 10 SCC 459
43summarizing the aforementioned principle into a four-pronged test, the Bench
held:
“…The action must be sanctioned by law;
The proposed action must be necessary in a democratic
society for a legitimate aim;
The extent of such interference must be proportionate to the
need for such interference;
There must be procedural guarantees against abuse of such
interference.”
50. In the case of Gujrat Mazdoor Sabha (Supra) during covid-19, the
Central Government had passed a notification severely affecting the pay of
unskilled workers, on the grounds of national emergency. This notification was
challenged on grounds of violation of Article 14, specifically in violation of the
principle of proportionality. The Court held that, in order to determine the
validity of state action that could infringe on fundamental rights, it must pass
the following conditions, namely, (i) The interfering with the fundamental rights
must have a state purpose, (ii) the said rights infringing measure must be based
on a rational nexus between the interference and the state aim,(iii) the measures
bust be necessary to achieve the state aim,(iv) the restrictions must be necessary
to protect the legitimate objective and (v) The state should provide sufficient
safeguards for the possibility of an abuse of such rights infringing interference.
44On the basis of these conditions of proportionality, this Court struck down the
notification.
51. Although the fifth prong, as mentioned in the Gujarat Mazdoor Sabha
(Supra) has not been expressly mentioned in Puttaswamy, Chandrachud J (as
His Lordship then was), in our view, rightly has read that in in the Gujarat
Mazdoor Sabha case (supra) to complete the test. State action that leaves
sufficient room for abuse, thereby acting as a threat against free exercise of
fundamental rights, ought to necessarily be factored in in the delicate balancing
act that the judiciary is called upon to do in determining the constitutionality of
such state action - whether legislative, executive, administrative or otherwise.
The relevant paragraph of the judgment has been mentioned herein:
“The principle of proportionality has been recognized in a
slew of cases by this Court, most notably in the seven-judge
bench decision in K S Puttaswamy vs. Union of India. The
principle of proportionality envisages an analysis of the
following conditions in order to determine the validity of
state action that could impinge on fundamental rights:
(i) A law interfering with fundamental rights must be in
pursuance of a legitimate state aim;
(ii) The justification for rights-infringing measures that
interfere with or limit the exercise of fundamental rights and
liberties must be based on the existence of a rational
connection between those measures, the situation in fact
and the object sought to be achieved;
45(iii) The measures must be necessary to achieve the object
and must not infringe rights to an extent greater than is
necessary to fulfil the aim;
(iv) Restrictions must not only serve legitimate purposes;
they must also be necessary to protect them; and
(v) The State should provide sufficient safeguards against
the abuse of such interference.
We are unable to find force in the arguments of the learned
counsel for the Respondent. The impugned notifications do
not serve any purpose, apart from reducing the overhead
costs of all factories in the State, without regard to the
nature of their manufactured products. It would be
fathomable, and within the PART G 30 realm of reasonable
possibility during a pandemic, if the factories producing
medical equipment such as life-saving drugs, personal
protective equipment or sanitisers, would be exempted by
way of Section 65(2), while justly compensating the workers
for supplying their valuable labour in a time of urgent need.
However, a blanket notification of exemption to all
factories, irrespective of the manufactured product, while
denying overtime to the workers, is indicative of the
intention to capitalize on the pandemic to force an already
worndown class of society, into the chains of servitude.”
52. We have already in the discussion for the reasonable classification test
held that the interfering law, i.e. the impugned notification that creates the
classification, does not have a rational nexus to the object sought to be
achieved, and thus, violates the first two prongs of the proportionality test.
53. We then come to the third and fourth prong of the proportionality test, i.e
whether the classification created by the Authority was a necessity to achieve
the state aim of compensating those landowners that are either direct residents
46of the land or the land exists as their primary source of income and whether
such measure was proportional to the object sought to be achieved. For this, it is
pertinent to refer to Section 23 of the Act, which provides for matters to be
taken into account while determining the compensation. The said Section reads
as under : -
“23. Matters to be considered in determining compensation.
-
(1) In determining the amount of compensation to be
awarded for land acquired under this Act, the Court shall
take into consideration
first, the market value of the land at the date of the
publication of the [notification under section 4, sub-section
(1)];
secondly, the damage sustained by the person interested, by
reason of the taking of any standing crops trees which may
be on the land at the time of the Collector's taking
possession thereof;
thirdly, the damage (if any) sustained by the person
interested, at the time of the Collector's taking possession of
the land, by reason of serving such land from his other land;
fourthly, the damage (if any) sustained by the person
interested, at the time of the Collector's taking possession of
the land, by reason of the acquisition injuriously affecting
his other property, movable or immovable, in any other
manner, or his earnings;
fifthly, in consequence of the acquisition of the land by the
Collector, the person interested is compelled to change his
residence or place of business, the reasonable expenses (if
any) incidental to such change, and
47sixthly, the damage (if any) bona fide resulting from
diminution of the profits of the land between the time of the
publication of the declaration under section 6 and the time
of the Collector's taking possession of the land.”
54. A bare perusal of Section 23 would show that, the grounds for
classification as purported by the GNOIDA authority, have already been
covered by Section 23 of the Act. The fifth point of the said Section squarely
covers the requirement of compensating for rehabilitation of the affected
landowners. In the presence of an already existing provision in the act, the
classification created by the GNOIDA authority, must exist in furtherance of the
said Section, and not in contrast of.
55. The classification, as discussed above, if allowed to exist, can lead to
several Gair-pushtaini landowners who may also need to be rehabilitated,
cannot rehabilitate themselves without compensation for the same. This
circumstance alone besides being discriminatroy pits the said classification
against Section 23 of the Act, causing an insubordination to the 1894 Act. Such
a mischief, if allowed to exist, would not only nullify the purpose of the Act, but
also violate the third and fourth principle of the proportionality test, and hence
is liable to be struck down.
4856. Further, it is also important to note that the classification, even if allowed
to exist, does not come with any safeguards against its potential abuse. As
mentioned above, the said notification by way of its classification creates
disastrous mischief, and the notification does nothing to remedy such potential
abuse. No guidelines for the said classification exist, nor are there any bars
placed. If such classification is left unchecked, it may lead to bad precedence,
and disastrous ramifications in the future. This lack of substantive guidelines
also violates the fifth prong of the proportionality test.
57. On the basis of the abovementioned discussions emerging from the
settled principles, Issue no. 2 is answered in affirmative and in favour of the
Appellants herein, and the impugned classification is liable to be struck down as
violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.
Whether the classification made by the Full-Bench of the High Court
between Pushtaini landowners and Gair-pushtaini landowners is in
contravention to the law laid down by this Hon’ble Court in the case of
Nagpur Improvement Trust and another vs. Vithal Rao and others (1973) 1
SCC 500?
58. In the case of Nagpur Improvement Trust (Supra) this Hon’ble Court
was tasked to deal with the question of whether certain provisions the Nagpur
Improvement Trust Act, 1936 were in violation of Article 14. Here, the
49impugned provisions of the said Act allowed the acquisition of lands at rates
lower than the rates as prescribed in the Land Acquisition Act. What is relevant
to our case, is that the Court, while deciding this matter, held that the authority,
while acquiring land, cannot distinguish between types of owners, as the object
of achieving land for public purposes is met with, irrespective of the type of
owner whose land is being acquired. The relevant paragraphs from the judgment
reads as under:-
“It is now well-settled that the State can make a reasonable
classification for the purpose of legislation. It is equally
well-settled that the classification in order to be reasonable
must satisfy two tests: (i) the classification must be founded
on intelligible differentia and (ii) the differentia must have a
rational relation with the object sought to be achieved by
the legislation in question.
In this connection it must be borne in mind that the object
itself should be lawful. The object itself cannot be
discriminatory, for otherwise, for instance, if the object is to
discriminate against one section of the minority the
discrimination cannot be justified on the ground that there
is a reasonable classification because it has rational
relation to the object sought to be achieved.
What can be reasonable classification for the purpose of
determining compensation if the object of the legislation is
to compulsorily acquire land for public purposes?
It would not be disputed that different principles of
compensation cannot be formulated for lands acquired on
the basis that the owner is old or young, healthy or ill, tall
or short, or whether the owner has inherited the property or
built it with his own efforts, or whether the owner is
50politician or an advocate. Why is this sort of classification
not sustainable? Because the object being to compulsorily
acquire for a public purpose, the object is equally achieved
whether the land belongs to one type of owner or another
type.”
59. In our opinion, a bare reading of the abovementioned judgment makes it
amply clear that the classification made by the GNOIDA authority for the
purposes of awarding differential compensation is bad in law, and it is precisely
this kind of classification that has been barred. When the purpose of the
acquisition of the land is for the benefit of the public at large, then the nature of
the owner of the said land is inconsequential to the purpose. If such a
classification on the basis of the nature of owner is allowed, then on the same
grounds, there might be a possibility of future classifications where
powerholding members of the society may get away with a larger
compensation, and the marginalized may get lesser compensation. This is
precisely what this Court in the abovementioned judgment predicted, and to pre-
empt such arbitrary classification, clarified the position in law.
60. The Land Acquisition Act does not distinguish between classes of
owners, and uniformly provides compensation to all class of landowners. The
classification made between Pushtaini landowners and Gair-pushtaini
51landowners, on the basis of the reasoning mentioned above, is violative of the
law laid down in the Nagpur Trust case (Supra) and Article 14 of the
Constitution.
Conclusion
61. In light of the above-mentioned reasoning, we are of the opinion that the
classification made by both the executive actions is bad in law, and is liable to
be set aside. The Land Acquisition Act does not envisage any differential
compensation on the basis of such classification, and hence, this Court must
infer the compensation to be provided by the executive actions within the
confines of Section 23 of the Act.
62. Section 23 of the Land Acquisition Act states out the grounds for granting
compensation in cases of acquisition of land under the Act. One such reason for
the grant of compensation is rehabilitation, and it is this need for granting
compensation for rehabilitation under the Act that is echoed by the impugned
notification. A bare reading of both the executive actions in consonance with
the Act would show that the need for giving compensation for rehabilitation is
valid in law and is backed by the parent statute. The mischief then, is only
52limited to the arbitrary classification made by such actions. In such a case, we
are of the opinion that since the mischief lies only within the classification, it
can be severed, and the remaining part of the executive actions that sets out to
grant compensation for the purpose of rehabilitation remains valid in law.
63. Once the classification is removed, and the executive actions are read in
consonance with the parent act, we would see that since the Act, and now even
the executive actions do not discriminate in terms of compensation, the ex-
gratia payment and the increased base amount, as enunciated by the executive
actions, must be given to all landowners in the subject area.
64. At this stage, we would like to state that while the objective of the said
classification might have been noble, however, such classification only on the
basis of conjectures and surmises cannot be sustained. If a claim is being made
to differentiate between class of persons, such claim must be backed by
empirical data. While this Court is not a fact-finding Court and is a Court of
law, however, the law must also not be understood in isolation, but in the
context in which it exists, as the law does not exist like an object within the
statutes, but lives and evolves with the people it governs.
5365. Further, in cases of administrative action, even if the classification has a
rational nexus to the objective of the notification, the classification must also be
legitimized by the parent statute. If the parent statute does not allow for a
classification, then, even if the classification vis-à-vis the notification is able to
pass the tests of Article 14, it would still be liable to struck down if the parent
statute does not allow for the same.
66. The establishment of Greater Noida, as discussed above, was done for a
noble purpose, i.e., to accommodate in the city all those who came travelling
from every corner of the country in search of a better life. While doing so
however, as can be seen in the present case, some residents whose land was
subject to acquisition in the pursuit of the said aim, were faced with
discrimination. In such circumstance, it becomes the duty of this Court to
dispense justice, and rectify the harm caused to those at the receiving end of the
discrimination.
67. In view of the above discussions, the impugned judgment passed by the
Full Bench of the High Court is not liable to be sustained and stands set aside.
As a consequence, the Writ Petition filed by the appellants before the High
54Court stands allowed and the appellants are held entitled to the reliefs claimed
in the said Writ Petition.
68. Accordingly, the appeals stand allowed.
69. In the facts and circumstances, we do not make any order as to costs.
