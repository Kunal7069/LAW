Criminal Appeal No. 2153/2013

MOHAN M. SHANTANAGOUDAR, J.
The appellants herein were charged, tried and convicted for
offences punishable under Section 302 read with Section 34 and
Section 201 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter ‘IPC’). The High
Court confirmed the judgment of conviction passed by the Trial
Court and hence they are in appeal before us.
12. The brief facts of the case are as under:­
Accused No. 1 – Smt. Ragila had an illicit relationship with
Accused No. 2 – Shri Nawaz. The accused No. 1 is the wife of the
deceased.
3. The deceased used to suspect the fidelity of Accused No. 1
as well as his daughter’s integrity. He was of the opinion that
Accused No. 2 Nawaz not only had an illicit relationship with
Accused No. 1 but also with the elder daughter of the deceased.
4. On the date of the incident at about 9.00 a.m., the deceased
quarrelled with Accused No.1 and called her a ‘prostitute’. He
also told her that Accused No. 1 has converted the daughter into
a prostitute as well. At that point of time, Accused No. 2 came
from the first floor and asked the deceased not to quarrel with
Accused No. 1 and her daughters. Since the deceased did not
stop, Accused No. 2 slapped the face of the deceased.
Immediately, thereafter, both the accused throttled the deceased
with the help of a towel and burnt the dead body to try to conceal
the offence. Subsequently, they transported the dead body in a
Maruti Car owned by PW 15 and abandoned the body elsewhere.
25. The dead body was found after two days following the
incident by PW 1, who lodged the First Information Report. After
about 40 days, extra­judicial confession of Accused No.1 was
recorded by PW 8 (teacher of the village) and based on the same
and other material collected subsequent thereto, the charge­sheet
came to be filed.
6. The Trial Court as well as the High Court convicted both the
accused for the offences punishable under Section 302 and
Section 201 of IPC.
7. Shri S. Nagamuthu, learned senior counsel appearing on
behalf of the appellants, taking us through the material available
on record contends that the entire case is built up on the extra­
judicial confession which is a weak piece of evidence. He further
submits that there is no reason for Accused No.1 to confess
before PW 8 who is a teacher of a school and stranger to the
family and that too after 40 days. He further draws our attention
that the dead­body was not identified even after superimposition
test. The aspect of motive is deposed by PW 17, who is the maid
servant working in the house of accused. According to him, if the
extra­judicial confession is disbelieved, the accused are entitled
3to get acquitted. Alternatively, he submitted that even assuming
that extra­judicial confession is believed in its entirety, the case
may fall under Section 304 Part I of the IPC.
8. Mr. M. Yogesh Kanna, learned counsel appearing for the
State argued in support of the judgments of the Trial Court and
the High Court.
9. Both the Courts below have relied upon the extra­judicial
confession which is said to have been made by Accused No.1
before PW 8 who is a teacher of the school. We have perused the
extra­judicial confession, read over to us by Shri Nagamuthu,
learned senior counsel, and translated by him in English.
10. It is no doubt that the extra­judicial confession is recorded
by PW 8 who is a teacher after about 40 days of the incident in
question. Admittedly PW 8 is not the relative of the deceased nor
the relative of the accused. If one goes through the extra­judicial
confession, it is clear that the same is recorded as if it is a
statement recorded under Section 161 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973.
11. Be that as it may, both the Courts below on facts have relied
upon the extra­judicial confession and we find that the extra­
4judicial confession in all probability might have been made by
Accused No. 1 implicating herself and other accused. In other
words, we also subscribe to the views of the Trial Court as well as
by the High Court that such a confession was made by Accused
No.1
12. Material on record also reveals that Accused No.1 tried to
hide the offence for about 40 days by giving false explanation
about the whereabouts of her husband. Be that as it may, on
going through the extra­judicial confession carefully, we find that
the case may fall under Section 304 Part I of IPC inasmuch as
the offence may fall under explanation 1 of Section 300.
Immediately, after hearing the deceased calling the Accused No. 1
and her daughter as prostitutes, the Accused No. 2 suddenly
slapped the cheek of the deceased. Immediately, after receipt of
said assault, the deceased fell down unconscious and thereafter
he was throttled to death. Everything has occurred in the fraction
of a minute. Since the accused, because of the aforesaid conduct
of the deceased calling accused No. 1 and her daughter as
prostitute, was deprived of the power of self­control. The sudden
5provocation by the deceased has resulted in the incident in
question.
13. The deceased provoked the accused No.1 by uttering the
word ‘prostitute’. In our society, no lady would like to hear such a
word from her husband. Most importantly, she would not be
ready to hear such a word against her daughters. The incident is
a result of a sudden and grave provocation by the deceased.
Since the body came to be transported by the accused to a
different place in order to hide the offence, the accused are
rightly convicted for offence under Section 201 of IPC.
14. Having regard to the totality of the facts and circumstances
of the case, the following orders are made:­
(A) The judgments of the Trial Court in S.C. 10/2005 and the
High Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 563/2007 and 599/2007
convicting the accused for offence punishable under Section 302
of IPC stands modified and the accused are hereby convicted
under Section 304 Part I of IPC and sentenced to rigorous
imprisonment for a term of ten years. Sentence imposed on the
accused under Section 304 Part I and Section 201 IPC shall run
6concurrently. The accused will have the benefit of set off of the
period already undergone in prison.
(B) The appeals are accordingly allowed in part.
