Union of India and Ors Appellant(s)
Versus
Sitaram Mishra and Anr Respondent(s)

Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, J
1. The first respondent was enlisted as a constable in the CRPF on 20
September 1971. He was posted in the 41st Batallion in September 1989.
In February 1998, he was functioning as Head Constable and was
deployed at Ractiacherra, Police Station Jirania, West Tripura. A carbine
was issued to him. It is alleged that, on 18 February 1998 at about 0945
hours, while he was cleaning the barrel of his loaded 9 MM carbine in the
barracks, he did not remove the magazine and proceeded to clean the
carbine carelessly. As a result, eight rounds were fired. One of the bullets
hit a co-constable who was present in the barracks. He died as a result of
the injuries which were sustained. A First Information Report was lodged.
The Commandant initiated a disciplinary proceeding against the first
respondent. The charge was in the following terms:
“That, No.710170325 HC Sita Ram Mishra, while serving as a Head
Constable (GD) in “B” Coy, duct and remissness in his capacity as a
member of the Force under Section 11(1) of CRPF Act, 1949,
punishable under Rule 27(a) of CRPF Rules, 1955, in that he on
18.02.1998 at about 0945 hours, started cleaning barrel of his loaded 92
MM Carbine (No.15356032, Butt no.13) in men barrack of B/41 Bn.
CRPF, carelessly without removing its magazine on his bed. In this
process of clearning, 08 Rounds got fired automatically and one of these
bullet hit No.901310271 Ct. Sailesh Kumar Tiwari who was present there
in the barrack. No.901310271 Ct. Sailesh Kumar Tiwari subsequently
succumbed to his injuries at about 1020 hours same day in Civil
Hospital, Jirania, Agartala.”
2. After conducting a disciplinary enquiry, the Enquiry Officer submitted
a report on 12 March 1999. The first respondent was held to be guilty of
misconduct by the disciplinary authority, as a result of which the penalty of
dismissal from service was imposed under Section 11(1) of the CRPF Act
1949 read with Rule 27(a) of the CRPF Rules 1955. The appeal as well as
the revision petition filed by the first respondent were dismissed.
3. The first respondent was also tried of an offence under Section 304
of the Indian Penal Code 18601. He was acquitted by the Judicial
Magistrate, First Class, Agartala, Tripura West on 5 January 2002.
4. The writ petition filed by the first respondent under Article 226 of the
Constitution to challenge his dismissal from service was dismissed by a
learned Single Judge. However, in a writ appeal, the Division Bench
interfered with the judgment of the learned Single Judge on the ground that
the charge of misconduct was not established. Since the first respondent
had, in the meantime, retired from service, the Division Bench directed that
he be treated in service until he attained the age of superannuation and be
paid full back wages after adjusting the subsistence allowance paid during
the period of suspension.
5. The High Court, by its impugned judgment in the writ appeal, held
that:
1 “IPC”3
(i) The charge of misconduct was belied by the depositions of PW 5
and PW 6 during the course of the disciplinary enquiry to the effect
that the carbine was disassembled when it was being cleaned;
(ii) There was no evidence in support of the finding of misconduct;
(iii) The departmental proceedings as well as the criminal case were
“same and identical”; and
(iv) The departmental proceedings were not sustainable after the
acquittal of the first respondent from the criminal case.
6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants submitted
that the Division Bench of the High Court has fallen into a serious error in
interfering with the dismissal of the writ petition by the learned Single
Judge, particularly in a case such as present, where the charge of
misconduct was duly proved on the basis of the evidence adduced in the
disciplinary enquiry. It was further submitted that the facts are not in
dispute, viz., that the first respondent was in possession of a carbine which
was assigned to him for his official duties; he was in the men's barracks;
and the carbine was while being handled by the first respondent discharged
as a result of which one of the bullets struck his colleague who died as a
result of the injuries. On these facts, it was submitted that a case of
negligence was clearly established which warranted dismissal from service.
The charge of criminal wrongdoing has to be proved beyond reasonable
doubt whereas the disciplinary proceeding is governed by a preponderance
of probability. On these grounds, it was submitted that the High Court was
in error in interfering with the exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction by the
competent authority.4
7. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first
respondent, has placed reliance on the decision of the Judicial Magistrate
acquitting the first respondent of the charge under Section 304 of the IPC.
It was urged that on the basis of the judgment of acquittal, it is evident that
there is no substance in the case that the first respondent was guilty of a
rash and negligent act. Moreover, it was urged that the first respondent has
since retired from service and his pensionary dues should be directed to be
released.
8. From the material on the record, certain facts are not in dispute.
They are:
(i) The first respondent was in possession of a weapon which had
been issued to him as a Head Constable in the CRPF posted at the
41st Batallion at the relevant point of time;
(ii) The death of the co-employee occurred in the course of the
handling of the weapon by the first respondent; and
(iii) Both the first respondent and the victim were in the men's barracks
of the 41st Batallion.
9. The disciplinary authority found that the charge of misconduct was
sustainable on the basis of the evidence on the record. The Division Bench
of the High Court reversed the judgment of the learned Single Judge
primarily on the basis of the depositions of PW 5 and PW 6 to the effect that
the 9MM carbine was disassembled. The High Court was manifestly in
error in reappreciating the evidence which was adduced during the
disciplinary enquiry. The issue, in the exercise of judicial review against a
finding of misconduct in a disciplinary enquiry, is whether the finding is5
sustainable with reference to some evidence on the record. The High Court
can, it is well-settled, interfere only in a situation where the finding is based
on no evidence. In such a situation, the finding is rendered perverse. In
the present case, the impugned judgment of the Division Bench adverts to
the statement of the first respondent of the circumstances in which the
death of his colleague occurred. The relevant extract is thus:
“...When I was about to go outside to see my luggage, I fitted the
magazine of my Carbine and JAB MAINE MAGAZINE PAR HATH MARA
TO CARBINE SE FIRE HONE LAGA.”
10. This part of the admission of the first respondent clearly indicates
that it was as a result of the handling of the weapon by the first respondent
that the bullets were fired and the death of his colleague occurred in
consequence. None of the material facts are in dispute.
11. In this view of the matter, the High Court was manifestly in error in
interfering with the findings of the disciplinary enquiry, particularly when a
learned Single Judge had, in the course of his judgment, found no
irregularity in the enquiry. The punishment of dismissal is not
disproportionate to the misconduct proved.
12. The second ground, which has weighed with the High Court, is
equally specious. A disciplinary enquiry is governed by a different standard
of proof than that which applies to a criminal case. In a criminal trial, the
burden lies on the prosecution to establish the charge beyond reasonable
doubt. The purpose of a disciplinary enquiry is to enable the employer to
determine as to whether an employee has committed a breach of the
service rules. In the present case, the learned Single Judge has adverted
to Circular Order No.16/85, which inter alia imposed the following obligation6
upon the members of the CRPF:
“(c) strict fire discipline should be enforced by supervisory staff at all
levels. In other words, loaded, and cocked weapons should not be kept
by the troops while in barracks/non operational places.
Severe disciplinary action must be taken against the defaulters.”
The fact that the first respondent was acquitted in the course of the criminal
trial cannot operate ipso facto as a ground for vitiating the finding of
misconduct which has been arrived at during the course of the disciplinary
proceedings. The High Court, in our view, has drawn an erroneous
inference from the decision of this Court in Capt M Paul Anthony v Bharat
Gold Mines Ltd2. The High Court adverted to the following principle of law
laid down in the above judgment:
“...While in the departmental proceedings the standard of proof is one of
preponderance of the probabilities, in a criminal case, the charge has to
be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubts. The little
exception may be where the departmental proceedings and the criminal
case are based on the same set of facts and the evidence in both the
proceedings is common without there being a variance.”
13. It is undoubtedly correct that the charge in the criminal trial arose
from the death of a co-employee in the course of the incident resulting from
the firing of a bullet which took place from the weapon which was assigned
to the first respondent as a member of the Force. But the charge of
misconduct is on the ground of the negligence of the first respondent in
handling his weapon and his failure to comply with the departmental
instructions in regard to the manner in which the weapon should be
handled. Consequently, the acquittal in the criminal case was not a ground
for setting aside the penalty which was imposed in the course of the
disciplinary enquiry. Hence, having regard to the parameters that govern
2 (1999) 3 SCC 6797
the exercise of judicial review in disciplinary matters, we are of the view that
the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court is unsustainable.
14. For the above reasons, we allow the appeal and set aside the
impugned judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court
dated 14 December 2007. In consequence, we maintain the judgment of
the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition filed by the first
respondent under Article 226 of the Constitution. There shall be no order
as to costs.
