IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 631 OF 2008
RUKMINI YESHWANT KHARADE & ANR. ..... APPELLANTS
VERSUS
STATE OF MAHARASHTRA ..... RESPONDENT
O R D E R
1. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.
2. Several arguments have been raised by the learned
counsel for the appellants with regard to the proximity
of the last alleged cruelty and the actual date of the
suicide. We see from the evidence that some kind of
unpleasant remarks had been made against the deceased in
May, 2001 when she gave birth to a female child and the
allegation is that the appellants at that stage taunted
her on that account. We, however, see that there is no
allegation whatsoever in the evidence that after May,
2001 any kind of ill-treatment had been meted out to the
deceased though she was living in the matrimonial home
and had committed suicide in April, 2002. However,
despite this assertion we are not inclined to examine theCrl.A. No. 631 of 2008
2
merits of the case at this stage as a sentence of five
years rigorous imprisonment has been imposed on the
appellants under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code and
one year rigorous imprisonment under Section 498A, both
the sentences to run concurrently as we have been told by
the learned counsel for the appellants that as of today
the appellants have undergone almost four years of the
sentence. We, therefore, feel that ends of justice would
be met if the sentence imposed under Section 306 of IPC
is reduced to that already undergone.
3. With this modification in the order of the High
Court, the appeal is dismissed.
4. We are told that the appellants are in custody.
They shall be released forth with if not required in
connection with any other case.
