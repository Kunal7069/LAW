[REPORTABLE]
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION
Transfer Petition (Crl.) No.225 of 2020
Rhea Chakraborty Petitioner
Versus
State of Bihar & Ors. Respondent(s)
JUDGMENT
Hrishikesh Roy, J.
1. This Transfer Petition is filed under section 406
of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (for short
“CrPC”) read with Order XXXIX of the Supreme
Court Rules, 2013 with prayer for transfer of
the FIR No. 241 of 2020 (dated 25.7.2020) under
Sections 341, 342, 380, 406, 420, 306, 506 and 120B
of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (for short “IPC”)
registered at the Rajeev Nagar Police Station, Patna
and all consequential proceedings, from the
jurisdiction of the Additional Chief Judicial
Page 1 of 36Magistrate III, Patna Sadar, to the Additional Chief
Metropolitan Magistrate, Bandra Mumbai. The matter
relates to the unnatural death of the actor Sushant
Singh Rajput on 14.6.2020, at his Bandra residence at
Mumbai. The deceased resided within Bandra Police
Station jurisdiction and there itself, the unnatural
death under section 174 of CrPC was reported.
2. The petitioner is a friend of the deceased, and
she too is in the acting field since last many years.
As regards the allegations against the petitioner in
the FIR, the petitioner claims that she has been
falsely implicated in the Patna FIR, filed by Krishan
Kishor Singh (respondent no. 2) – the father of
the deceased actor. The petitioner and the deceased
were in a live-in relationship but on 8.6.2020, a few
days prior to the death of the actor, she had shifted
to her own residence at Mumbai. According to the
petitioner, the Mumbai Police is competent to
undertake the investigation, even for the FIR lodged
at Patna.

Respondent No. 1 (State of Bihar), Mr. Vikas Singh,
learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of
respondent No. 2 (Complainant), Dr. A.M. Singhvi and
Mr. R. Basant, learned Senior Counsel appearing on
behalf of respondent No. 3 (State of Maharashtra) and
Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General of India
appearing on behalf of respondent No. 4 (Union of
India)
4. The petitioner contends that the incidents alleged
in the Complaint lodged by the father of the
deceased, have taken place entirely within the
jurisdiction of State of Maharashtra and therefore,
the Complaint as received, should have been forwarded
to the jurisdictional police station at Bandra,
Mumbai for conducting the investigation. However,
despite want of jurisdiction, the Complaint was
registered at Patna only because of political
pressure brought upon the Bihar Police authorities.
Mr Shyam Divan, the learned Senior Counsel for the
Page 3 of 36Petitioner argues that the courts in Bihar do not
exercise lawful jurisdiction in the subject matter of
the Complaint and since the acts alleged in the
Complaint are relatable to Mumbai jurisdiction, the
mere factum of Complainant being a resident of Patna,
does not confer jurisdiction on the Bihar police to
conduct the investigation. Adverting to the
subsequent transfer of the investigation to the CBI,
Mr. Divan argues that since the Bihar police lacked
jurisdiction to investigate the allegations in the
Complaint, the transfer of the investigation to the
CBI on Bihar Government’s consent, would not amount
to a lawful consent of the State government, under
Section 6 of the Delhi Special Police Establishment
Act, 1946 (for short “DSPE Act”). The FIR according
to the petitioner is contradictory and the Complaint
fails to disclose how the alleged actions of the
petitioner, led to the suicidal death of the actor.
The petitioner projects that she has fully co-
operated with the Mumbai Police in their inquiry but
will have no objection if the investigation is
conducted by the CBI. Mr. Shyam Divan the learned
Page 4 of 36Senior Counsel submits that justice needs to be done
in this case and powers under Article 142 of the
Constitution can be invoked by the Court.
5. Representing the State of Bihar, Mr. Maninder
Singh, the learned Senior Counsel submits that the
Complaint disclosed a cognizable offence and
therefore, it was incumbent for the Patna Police to
register the FIR and proceed with the investigation.
Since allegations of criminal breach of trust,
Cheating and defalcation of money from the account of
the deceased are alleged, the consequences of the
offence are projected to be within the jurisdiction
of the State of Bihar. The Senior Counsel highlights
that the Mumbai Police was conducting the enquiry
into the unnatural death of the actor u/s 174, 175
CrPC and such proceeding being limited to
ascertaining the cause of death, does not empower
Mumbai Police to undertake any investigation, on the
allegations in the Complaint of the Respondent No 2,
without registration of an FIR at Mumbai. Referring
to the non-cooperation and obstruction of the
Maharashtra authorities to the SIT of Bihar Police
Page 5 of 36which reached Mumbai on 27.07.2020 and the
quarantined detention of the Superintendent of
Police, Patna who had reached Mumbai on 02.08.2020,
senior counsel argues that the Mumbai Police was
trying to suppress the real facts and were not
conducting a fair and professional inquiry. Since no
investigation relatable to the allegations in the
complaint was being conducted and FIR was not
registered by the Mumbai Police, the action of the
Bihar Police in registering the Complaint, is
contended to be legally justified. On that basis, the
Bihar Government’s consent for entrustment of the
investigation to the CBI is submitted to satisfy the
requirement of Section 6 of the DSPE Act. Besides,
as the petitioner herself has called for a CBI
investigation and as the CBI has since registered a
case and commenced their investigation, (on the
request of the State of Bihar), the Senior Counsel
submits that this transfer petition is infructuous.
6. Projecting the agony of the deceased’s father, Mr.
Vikas Singh, the learned Senior Counsel submits that
the Complainant has lost his only son under
Page 6 of 36suspicious circumstances and was naturally interested
in a fair investigation to unravel the truth. The
inquiry by the Mumbai Police under section 174 of the
CrPC is not an investigation of the complainant’s
allegations and therefore the registration of the
case and investigation into those allegations by the
Bihar Police is contended to be justified. Since
only an investigation (not a case or appeal) is
pending at Patna, and a legally competent
investigation has commenced, invocation of Section
406 power by this Court to transfer the
investigation, is projected to be not merited. When
misappropriation and criminal breach of trust is
alleged in respect of the assets of the deceased
actor and the concerned property relatable to the
alleged offence, will have to be accounted eventually
to the Complainant (as a Class I legal heir of the
deceased), the action of the Patna Police is
contended to be within jurisdiction, under Section
179 read with Section 181(4) of the CrPC which speaks
of consequences ensuing at another place, as a result
of the alleged crime.
Page 7 of 367. Representing the State of Maharashtra, Dr.
Abhishek Manu Singhvi, the learned Senior Counsel
submits that following the unnatural death of Sushant
Singh Rajput on 14.06.2020 at his Bandra residence,
the Mumbai Police registered an Accidental Death
Report(ADR) and commenced inquiry under Section 174
of the CrPC to ascertain the cause of death and also
to determine whether the death was the result of some
criminal act committed by some other persons. In
course of the inquiry, the statements of 56 persons
were recorded and other evidence such as the Post
Mortem report, Forensic report etc have been
collected. If the inquiry discloses commission of a
cognizable offence, the Mumbai police will register a
FIR. According to Dr. Singhvi, there can be no outer
time limit for conclusion of Section 174 or Section
175 CrPC proceedings. The State of Maharashtra
Counsel argues that every offence shall ordinarily be
inquired into and tried by a Court within whose local
jurisdiction, the offence was committed and on that
basis, Dr Singhvi submits, that the Bihar police
should have transferred the Complaint to the Mumbai
Page 8 of 36Police authorities. Alternately, they could have
registered a “zero FIR” and then should have
transferred the case for investigation to Mumbai
police. Pointing towards potential misuse, Dr.
Singhvi submits that if registration of Complaint in
another state is permitted, it will enable a person
to choose the investigating authority and will
obstruct exercise of lawful jurisdiction by the local
police. This will impact the country’s federal
structure. The Senior Counsel refers to media
reports to project that the Bihar Police were
hesitant to register the Complaint of Respondent No 2
but they were prevailed upon by political pressure.
The Maharashtra counsel submits that the father and
other family members of the deceased in their
statements to the Mumbai Police, never mentioned
about the allegations in the Complaint and those are
projected to be afterthoughts and improvements. Under
the constitutional scheme, the States have exclusive
power to investigate a crime and the Senior Counsel
accordingly argues that crime investigation cannot be
routinely transferred to the Central Agency.
Page 9 of 36Referring to the reasons (a) sensitivity and (b)
Inter-state ramifications, given by the Bihar Police
for entrusting the investigation to the CBI, Dr.
Singhvi argues that the reasons are neither germane
nor bona fide. He submits that ordinarily, the
local police should conduct investigation into any
reported crime and entrustment of the investigation
to the CBI must be an exception to meet extraordinary
exigencies, but here consent was given by Bihar
government, for political exigencies.
8. Mr Tushar Mehta, the learned Solicitor General
of India, appears for the Union of India and the CBI.
He projects that the Maharashtra Police is yet to
register any FIR but is conducting only a limited
inquiry under section 174 of the CrPC, into the
unnatural death of the actor. In the absence of any
FIR by the Mumbai Police following the death of the
actor on 14.06.2020, the FIR registered at Patna at
the instance of the deceased’s father is projected to
be the only one pending. He therefore contends that
the present matter does not relate to two cases
pending in two different states. Referring to the
Page 10 of 36contradictory stand and the parallel allegation of
state’s Police being influenced by external factors
in both states, Mr. Mehta submits that this itself
justifies entrustment of the investigation to an
independent Central Agency. The learned Solicitor
General then points out that by acceding to the
request made by the State of Bihar, the CBI has
registered the FIR and commenced investigation.
Besides the Directorate of Enforcement, a central
agency, is also acting under the Prevention of Money
Laundering Act, 2002. He therefore argues that a fair
and impartial inquiry can be ensured if the police of
either state are kept away from investigating the
alleged crime, relating to the suspicious death of
the film actor. Adverting to the affidavit of the
Maharashtra Police that they have recorded the
statements of 56 persons in the section 174
proceedings, the Solicitor General submits that since
FIR is not yet registered and the Mumbai Police is
discharging limited functions under section 174 of
the CrPC, the investigation of any alleged crime
following registration of FIR is yet to legally
Page 11 of 36commence in Mumbai and as such, there is no case
pending in the State of Maharashtra which can justify
the invocation of powers under section 406 of the
CrPC.
9. Under the federal design envisaged by the
Constitution, Police is a state subject under List II
of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. Therefore,
investigation of a crime should normally be
undertaken by the concerned state’s police, where the
case is registered. There can be situations where a
particular crime by virtue of its nature and
ramification, is legally capable of being
investigated by police from different states or even
by other agencies. The entrustment of investigation
to the CBI is permitted either with consent of the
concerned state or on orders of the constitutional
court. However, investigation of a crime by multiple
authorities transgressing into the others domain, is
avoidable.
10. In the instant case, the petitioner repose
confidence on Mumbai police. The records of the case
Page 12 of 36produced before this Court, does not prima facie
suggest any wrong doing by the Mumbai Police.
However, their obstruction to the Bihar police team
at Mumbai could have been avoided since it gave rise
to suspicion on the bonafide of their inquiry. The
Police at Mumbai were conducting only a limited
inquiry into the cause of unnatural death, under
Section 174 CrPC and therefore, it cannot be said
with certainty at this stage that they will not
undertake an investigation on the other aspects of
the unnatural death, by registering a FIR.
11. Uncertain about the future contingency at Mumbai,
the father of the deceased has filed the Complaint at
Patna, levelling serious allegations against the
petitioner following which, the FIR is registered and
the Bihar Police has started their investigation.
The case is now taken over by the CBI at the request
of the Bihar government. The petitioner has no
objection for investigation by the CBI, but is
sceptical about the bonafide of the steps taken by
the Bihar government and the Patna police.
Page 13 of 3612. On the other hand, the projection from the side
of the Complainant and the Bihar government is that
the Mumbai Police even during the limited inquiry
under Section 174 CrPC, are attempting to shield the
real culprits under political pressure. This is
however, stoutly refuted by the State of Maharashtra
whose stand is that the Bihar police has no
jurisdiction to investigate the crime where, the
incident and criminal acts if any, have occurred
within the State of Maharashtra.
13. Transfer of investigation to the CBI cannot be a
routine occurrence but should be in exceptional
circumstances. One factor which however is
considered relevant for induction of the Central
Agency is to retain “public confidence in the
impartial working of the State agencies”, as was
recently reiterated for the Bench by Justice
Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, in Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs.
Union of India 2020 SCC Online SC 462. It is also
the consistent view of the Court that it is not for
the accused to choose the investigating agency. In
the instant case, political interference against both
Page 14 of 36states is alleged which has the potential of
discrediting the investigation. The legal process
must therefore be focused upon revelation of the
correct facts through credible and legally acceptable
investigation. It must be determined whether the
unnatural death was the result of some criminal acts.
In order to lend credibility to the investigation and
its conclusion, it would be desirable in my view, to
specify the authority, which should conduct the
investigation in this matter.
14. At this stage, having regard to the respective
stand of the parties, following core issues arise for
consideration in this case:
(a) Whether this Court has power to transfer
investigation (not case or appeal) under Section 406
of the CrPC;
(b) Whether the proceeding under Section 174 CrPC
conducted by the Mumbai Police to inquire into the
unnatural death, can be termed as an investigation;
(c) Whether it was within the jurisdiction of the
Patna Police to register the FIR and commence
investigation of the alleged incidents which took
Page 15 of 36place in Mumbai? As a corollary, what is the status
of the investigation by the CBI on the consent given
by the Bihar government; and
(d) What is the scope of the power of a single
judge exercising jurisdiction under section 406 of
the CrPC and whether this Court can issue direction
for doing complete justice, in exercise of plenary
power.
TRANSFER POWER UNDER SECTION 406 CRPC
15. Section 406 CrPC empowers the Supreme Court to
transfer cases and appeals. The scope of exercise of
this power is for securing the ends of justice. The
precedents suggest that transfer plea under Section
406 CrPC were granted in cases where the Court
believed that the trial may be prejudiced and fair
and impartial proceedings cannot be carried on, if
the trial continues. However, transfer of
investigation on the other hand was negated by this
Court in the case of Ram Chander Singh Sagar and Anr.
vs. State of Tamil Nadu, (1978) 2 SCC 35. Writing the
judgment Justice V R Krishna Iyer, declared that:-
Page 16 of 36“The Code of Criminal Procedure clothes this
Court with power under Section 406 to transfer a
case or appeal from one High Court or a Court
subordinate to one High Court to another High
Court or to a Court subordinate thereto. But, it
does not clothe this Court with the power to
transfer investigations from one police station
to another in the country simply because the
first information or a remand report is for
warded to a Court. The application before us
stems from a misconception about the scope of
Section 406. There is as yet no case pending
before any Court as has been made clear in the
counter affidavit of the State of Tamil Nadu. In
the light of this counter affidavit, nothing can
be done except to dismiss this petition.
“ 2. If the petitioners are being directed to
appear in a far-off court during investigatory
stage it is for them to move that court for
appropriate orders so that they may not be
tormented by long travel or otherwise teased by
judicial process. If justice is denied there are
other redresses, not under Section 406, though it
is unfortunate that the petitioners have not
chosen to move that court to be absolved from
appearance until necessitated by the
circumstances or the progress of the
investigation. To come to this Court directly
seeking an order of transfer is travelling along
the wrong street. We are sure that if the second
petitioner is ailing, as is represented, and this
fact is brought to the notice of the Court which
has directed her appearance, just orders will be
passed in case there is veracity behind the
representation. We need hardly say courts should
use their processes to the purpose of advancing
justice, not to harass parties. Anyway, so far as
the petition for transfer is concerned. there is
no merit we can see and so we dismiss it.”
Page 17 of 3616. The contrary references cited by the Petitioner
where transfer of investigation was allowed, do not
in any manner, refer to a determination on the
question of competence to transfer investigation
under Section 406. In the cited cases, relief was
granted without any discussion of the law, ignoring
the long standing ratio laid down in Ram Chander
Singh Sagar (Supra).
17. Having considered the contour of the power under
section 406 CrPC, it must be concluded that only
cases and appeals (not investigation) can be
transferred. The ratio in Ram Chander Singh Sagar and
Anr. (Supra) in my view, is clearly applicable in the
present matter.
SCOPE OF SECTION 174 CRPC PROCEEDING
18. The proceeding under Section 174 CrPC is limited
to the inquiry carried out by the police to find out
the apparent cause of unnatural death. These are not
in the nature of investigation, undertaken after
filing of FIR under Section 154 CrPC. In the instant
case, in Mumbai, no FIR has been registered as yet.
Page 18 of 36The Mumbai Police has neither considered the matter
under Section 175 (2) CrPC, suspecting commission of
a cognizable offence nor proceeded for registration
of FIR under Section 154 or referred the matter under
Section 157 CrPC, to the nearest magistrate having
jurisdiction.
19. On the above aspect, the ratio in Manoj K Sharma
vs. State of Chhatisgarh (2016) 9 SCC 1 will bear
scrutiny. This was a case of suicide by hanging and
Justice M B Lokur, speaking for the Bench held as
follows:-
“19. The proceedings under Section 174 have
a very limited scope. The object of the
proceedings is merely to ascertain whether
a person has died under suspicious
circumstances or an unnatural death and if
so what is the apparent cause of the death.
The question regarding the details as to
how the deceased was assaulted or who
assaulted him or under what circumstances
he was assaulted is foreign to the ambit
and scope of the proceedings under Section
174 of the Code. Neither in practice nor in
law was it necessary for the police to
mention those details in the inquest
report. It is, therefore, not necessary to
enter all the details of the overt acts in
the inquest report. The procedure under
Page 19 of 36Section 174 is for the purpose of
discovering the cause of death, and the
evidence taken was very short……
20. …… Sections 174 and 175 of the Code
afford a complete Code in itself for the
purpose of “inquiries” in cases of
accidental or suspicious deaths and are
entirely distinct from the “investigation”
under Section 157 of the Code…..
**** **** **** **** ****
22. In view of the above, we are of the
opinion that the investigation on an
inquiry under Section 174 of the Code is
distinct from the investigation as
contemplated under Section 154 of the Code
relating to commission of a cognizable
offence…..”
20. In the present case, the Mumbai Police has
attempted to stretch the purview of Section 174
without drawing up any FIR and therefore, as it
appears, no investigation pursuant to commission of a
cognizable offence is being carried out by the Mumbai
police. They are yet to register a FIR. Nor they
have made a suitable determination, in terms of
Section 175(2) CrPC. Therefore, it is pre-emptive and
premature to hold that a parallel investigation is
being carried out by the Mumbai Police. In case of a
Page 20 of 36future possibility of cognizance being taken by two
courts in different jurisdictions, the issue could be
resolved under Section 186 CrPC and other applicable
laws. No opinion is therefore expressed on a future
contingency and the issue is left open to be decided,
if needed, in accordance with law.
21. Following the above, it is declared that the
inquiry conducted under Section 174 CrPC by the
Mumbai police is limited for a definite purpose but
is not an investigation of a crime under Section 157
of the CrPC.
JURISDICTION OF PATNA POLICE TO REGISTER COMPLAINT
22. The Respondent no 2 in his Complaint alleged
commission of a cognizable offence and therefore, it
was incumbent for the police to register the FIR and
commence the investigation. According to the
Complainant, his attempt from Patna to talk to his
son on telephone was thwarted by the accused persons
and the possibility of saving the life of his son
through father son engagement, was missed out. In
consequence, the Complainant lost his only son who at
Page 21 of 36the appropriate time, as the learned counsel has
vividly submitted, was expected to light the funeral
pyre of the father.
23. Registration of FIR is mandated when information
on cognizable offence is received by the police.
Precedents suggest that at the stage of
investigation, it cannot be said that the concerned
police station does not have territorial jurisdiction
to investigate the case. On this aspect the ratio in
Lalita Kumari Vs. Govt. of UP (2014) 2 SCC 1 is
relevant where on behalf of the Constitution Bench,
Chief Justice P Sathasivam, pronounced as under:-
“120.1. The registration of FIR is mandatory
under Section 154 of the Code, if the information
discloses commission of a cognizable offence and
no preliminary inquiry is permissible in such a
situation.
120.2. If the information received does not
disclose a cognizable offence but indicates the
necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry
may be conducted only to ascertain whether
cognizable offence is disclosed or not.”
24. The interpretation of Sections 177 and 178 of the
CrPC would be relevant on the issue. In Satvinder
Kaur Vs. State (Govt of NCT of Delhi) (1999) 8 SCC
Page 22 of 36728 for the Division Bench, Justice M B Shah wrote as
under:-
“12. A reading of the aforesaid sections would
make it clear that Section 177 provides for
“ordinary” place of enquiry or trial. Section
178, inter alia, provides for place of enquiry or
trial when it is uncertain in which of several
local areas an offence was committed or where the
offence was committed partly in one local area
and partly in another and where it consisted of
several acts done in different local areas, it
could be enquired into or tried by a court having
jurisdiction over any of such local areas. Hence,
at the stage of investigation, it cannot be held
that the SHO does not have territorial
jurisdiction to investigate the crime.”
25. Likewise, Justice Arijit Pasayat, in Y Abraham
Ajith vs. Inspector of Police, Chennai & Anr. (2004)
8 SCC 100, writing for the Division Bench pronounced
as follows:-
“12. The crucial question is whether any part
of the cause of action arose within the
jurisdiction of the court concerned. In terms
of Section 177 of the Code, it is the place
where the offence was committed. In essence
it is the cause of action for initiation of
the proceedings against the accused.
13. While in civil cases, normally the
expression “cause of action” is used, in
criminal cases as stated in Section 177 of
the Code, reference is to the local
jurisdiction where the offence is committed.
These variations in etymological expression
do not really make the position different.
Page 23 of 36The expression “cause of action” is,
therefore, not a stranger to criminal cases.
14. It is settled law that cause of action
consists of a bundle of facts, which give
cause to enforce the legal inquiry for
redress in a court of law. In other words, it
is a bundle of facts, which taken with the
law applicable to them, gives the allegedly
affected party a right to claim relief
against the opponent. It must include some
act done by the latter since in the absence
of such an act no cause of action would
possibly accrue or would arise.”
26. When allegation of Criminal Breach of Trust and
Misappropriation is made, on the jurisdictional
aspect, this Court in Asit Bhattacharjee Vs. Hanuman
Prasad Ojha (2007) 5 SCC 786, in the judgment written
by Justice S B Sinha, observed as under:-
“21. Section 181 provides for place of trial in
case of certain offences. Sub-section (4) of
Section 181 was introduced in the Code of
Criminal Procedure in 1973 as there existed
conflict in the decisions of various High Courts
as regards commission of offence of criminal
misappropriation and criminal breach of trust and
with that end in view, it was provided that such
an offence may be inquired into or tried by the
court within whose jurisdiction the accused was
bound by law or by contract to render accounts or
return the entrusted property, but failed to
discharge that obligation.
22. The provisions referred to hereinbefore
clearly suggest that even if a part of cause of
action has arisen, the police station concerned
situate within the jurisdiction of the Magistrate
Page 24 of 36empowered to take cognizance under Section 190(1)
of the Code of Criminal Procedure will have the
jurisdiction to make investigation.”
27. In the later judgment of Naresh Kavarchand Khatri
Vs. State of Gujarat (2008)8 SCC 300, this Court
reiterated the ratio in Satvinder Kaur(supra) and
Asit Bhattacharjee (Supra).
28. Once again, in Rasiklala Dalpatram Thakkar Vs.
State of Gujarat (2010) 1 SCC 1, while approving the
earlier decisions in Satvinder Kaur(supra) in the
judgment rendered by Justice Altamas Kabir as he was
then, the Supreme Court made it very clear that a
police officer cannot refrain from investigating a
matter on territorial ground and the issue can be
decided after conclusion of the investigation. It was
thus held:-
“27. In our view, both the trial court as well as
the Bombay High Court had correctly interpreted
the provisions of Section 156 CrPC to hold that
it was not within the jurisdiction of the
investigating agency to refrain itself from
holding a proper and complete investigation
merely upon arriving at a conclusion that the
offences had been committed beyond its
territorial jurisdiction.”
Page 25 of 3629. Moreover, the allegation relating to criminal
breach of trust and misappropriation of money which
were to be eventually accounted for in Patna (where
the Complainant resides), could prima facie indicate
the lawful jurisdiction of the Patna police. This
aspect was dealt succinctly by Justice J S Khehar, as
a member of the Division Bench in Lee Kun Hee,
President, Samsung Corporation, South Korea and
Others Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors. (2012) 3
SCC 132 and it was held as under:-
“38 ******
181. Place of trial in case of certain
offences.—(1)-(3)* * *
(4) Any offence of criminal
misappropriation or of criminal breach of
trust may be inquired into or tried by a
court within whose local jurisdiction the
offence was committed or any part of the
property which is the subject of the
offence was received or retained, or was
required to be returned or accounted for,
by the accused person.”
A perusal of the aforesaid provision
leaves no room for any doubt, that in
offences of the nature as are subject-
matter of consideration in the present
controversy, the court within whose local
jurisdiction, the whole or a part of the
Page 26 of 36consideration “… were required to be
returned or accounted for.…” would have
jurisdiction in the matter.”
30. Having regard to the law enunciated by this Court
as noted above, it must be held that the Patna police
committed no illegality in registering the Complaint.
Looking at the nature of the allegations in the
Complaint which also relate to misappropriation and
breach of trust, the exercise of jurisdiction by the
Bihar Police appears to be in order. At the stage of
investigation, they were not required to transfer the
FIR to Mumbai police. For the same reason, the Bihar
government was competent to give consent for
entrustment of investigation to the CBI and as such
the ongoing investigation by the CBI is held to be
lawful.
OPTIONS BEFORE MUMBAI POLICE
31. The Patna police although found to be competent
to investigate the allegation in the Complaint, the
FIR suggests that most of the transactions/incidents
alleged in the Complaint occurred within the
territorial jurisdiction of the State of Maharashtra.
Page 27 of 36The Mumbai Police was inquiring into the unnatural
death of the complainant’s son under section 174 of
the CrPC. So far, their inquiry has not resulted in
any FIR suggesting commencement of investigation on
the criminal aspects, if any. However, the incidents
referred to in the Complaint does indicate that the
Mumbai police also possess the jurisdiction to
undertake investigation on those circumstances.
Therefore, in the event of a case being registered
also at Mumbai, the consent for the investigation by
the CBI under Section 6 of the DSPE Act can be
competently given by Maharashtra Government.
INVESTIGATION ENTRUSTMENT TO CBI
32. While the CBI cannot conduct any investigation
without the consent of the concerned state as
mandated under section 6, the powers of the
Constitutional Courts are not fettered by the
statutory restriction of the DSPE Act. For this
proposition, one can usefully refer to State of West
Bengal Vs. Sampat Lal (1985) 1 SCC 317 where Justice
Ranganath Mishra in his judgment for the 3 judges
Bench, held that:-
Page 28 of 36“13. ……….It is certainly not for this Court at
the present stage to examine and come to a
conclusion as to whether this was a case of
suicide or murder. If as a result of
investigation, evidence is gathered and a trial
takes place the Sessions Judge will decide that
controversy and it may be that in due course such
controversy may be canvassed before this Court in
some form or the other. It would, therefore, be
wholly inappropriate at this stage to enter into
such a question.…………In our considered opinion,
Section 6 of the Act does not apply when the
Court gives a direction to the CBI to conduct an
investigation and counsel for the parties rightly
did not dispute this position……………”
33. Similarly, the Constitution Bench in the judgment
authored by Justice D K Jain in State of W B Vs.
Committee for Protection of Democratic Rights (2010)
3 SCC 571 pronounced as follows:-
“68. Thus, having examined the rival contentions
in the context of the constitutional scheme, we
conclude as follows:
(v) Restriction on Parliament by the Constitution
and restriction on the executive by Parliament
under an enactment, do not amount to restriction
on the power of the Judiciary under Articles 32
and 226 of the Constitution.
(vi) If in terms of Entry 2 of List II of the
Seventh Schedule on the one hand and Entry 2-A
and Entry 80 of List I on the other, an
investigation by another agency is permissible
subject to grant of consent by the State
concerned, there is no reason as to why, in an
exceptional situation, the Court would be
precluded from exercising the same power which
the Union could exercise in terms of the
provisions of the statute. In our opinion,
Page 29 of 36exercise of such power by the constitutional
courts would not violate the doctrine of
separation of powers. In fact, if in such a
situation the Court fails to grant relief, it
would be failing in its constitutional duty.
(vii) When the Special Police Act itself provides
that subject to the consent by the State, CBI can
take up investigation in relation to the crime
which was otherwise within the jurisdiction of
the State police, the Court can also exercise its
constitutional power of judicial review and
direct CBI to take up the investigation within
the jurisdiction of the State. The power of the
High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution
cannot be taken away, curtailed or diluted by
Section 6 of the Special Police Act. Irrespective
of there being any statutory provision acting as
a restriction on the powers of the Courts, the
restriction imposed by Section 6 of the Special
Police Act on the powers of the Union, cannot be
read as restriction on the powers of the
constitutional courts. Therefore, exercise of
power of judicial review by the High Court, in
our opinion, would not amount to infringement of
either the doctrine of separation of power or the
federal structure.”
34. As noted earlier, the FIR at Patna was
subsequently transferred to the CBI with consent of
the Bihar government during pendency of this Transfer
Petition. However, in future, if commission of
cognizable offence under section 175(2) CrPC is
determined, the possibility of parallel investigation
by the Mumbai Police cannot be ruled out. Section 6
of the DSPE Act, 1946 read with Section 5 prescribe
Page 30 of 36the requirement of consent from the State government,
before entrustment of investigation to the CBI. As
the CBI has already registered a case and commenced
investigation at the instance of the Bihar
government, uncertainty and confusion must be avoided
in the event of Mumbai Police also deciding to
simultaneously investigate the cognizable offence,
based on their finding in the inquiry proceeding.
Therefore, it would be appropriate to decide at this
stage itself as to who should conduct the
investigation on all the attending circumstances
relating to the death of the actor Sushant Singh
Rajput. This issue becomes relevant only if another
FIR is registered on the same issue, at Mumbai. A
decision by this Court on the point would confer
legitimacy to the investigation.
DIRECTION ON INVESTIGATION
35. The conflict between the two State governments
on, who amongst the two is competent to investigate
the case, is apparent here. In K.V. Rajendran Vs.
Superintendent of Police, CBCID, Chennai & Ors.
(2013) 12 SCC 480, the 3 judges Bench in the judgment
Page 31 of 36authored by Justice Dr B S Chauhan held that transfer
of investigation must be in rare and exceptional
cases in order to do complete justice between the
parties and to instil straight confidence in the
public mind. While the steps taken by the Mumbai
police in the limited inquiry under Section 174 CrPC
may not be faulted on the material available before
this Court, considering the apprehension voiced by
the stakeholders of unfair investigation, this Court
must strive to ensure that search for the truth is
undertaken by an independent agency, not controlled
by either of the two state governments. Most
importantly, the credibility of the investigation and
the investigating authority, must be protected.
36. The ongoing investigation by the CBI is held to
be lawful. In the event a new case is registered at
Mumbai on the same issue, in the fitness of things,
it would be appropriate if the latter case too gets
investigated by the same agency, on the strength of
this Court’s order. Such enabling order will make it
possible for the CBI to investigate the new case,
Page 32 of 36avoiding the rigors of Section 6 of the DSPE Act,
requiring consent from the State of Maharashtra.
37. In Monica Kumar (Dr.) and Anr. Vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh and Others (2008) 8 SCC 781, Justice L.S.
Panta in his judgment, referred to the inherent power
conferred on this Court and stated the following:-
“45. Under Article 142 of the
Constitution this Court in exercise of
its jurisdiction may pass such decree or
make such order as is necessary for
doing complete justice in any “cause” or
“matter” pending before it. The
expression “cause” or “matter” would
include any proceeding pending in court
and it would cover almost every kind of
proceeding in court including civil or
criminal. ………………………..This Court's power
under Article 142(1) to do “complete
justice” is entirely of different level
and of a different quality. What would
be the need of “complete justice” in a
cause or matter would depend upon the
facts and circumstances of each case and
while exercising that power the Court
would take into consideration the
express provisions of a substantive
statute. Any prohibition or restriction
contained in ordinary laws cannot act as
a limitation on the constitutional power
of this Court. Once this Court has
seisin of a cause or matter before it,
it has power to issue any order or
direction to do “complete justice” in
the matter.”
Page 33 of 3638. The above ratio makes it amply clear that the
Supreme Court in a deserving case, can invoke Article
142 powers to render justice. The peculiar
circumstances in this case require that complete
justice is done in this matter. How this is to be
achieved must now be decided.
39. As noted earlier, as because both states are
making acrimonious allegations of political
interference against each other, the legitimacy of
the investigation has come under a cloud. Accusing
fingers are being pointed and people have taken the
liberty to put out their own conjectures and
theories. Such comments, responsible or otherwise,
have led to speculative public discourse which have
hogged media limelight. These developments
unfortunately have the propensity to delay and
misdirect the investigation. In such situation, there
is reasonable apprehension of truth being a casualty
and justice becoming a victim.
40. The actor Sushant Singh Rajput was a talented
actor in the Mumbai film world and died well before
Page 34 of 36his full potential could be realised. His family,
friends and admirers are keenly waiting the outcome
of the investigation so that all the speculations
floating around can be put to rest. Therefore a
fair, competent and impartial investigation is the
need of the hour. The expected outcome then would be,
a measure of justice for the Complainant, who lost
his only son. For the petitioner too, it will be the
desired justice as she herself called for a CBI
investigation. The dissemination of the real facts
through unbiased investigation would certainly result
in justice for the innocents, who might be the target
of vilification campaign. Equally importantly, when
integrity and credibility of the investigation is
discernible, the trust, faith and confidence of the
common man in the judicial process will resonate.
When truth meets sunshine, justice will not prevail
on the living alone but after Life’s fitful fever,
now the departed will also sleep well. Satyameva
Jayate.
41. In such backdrop, to ensure public confidence in
the investigation and to do complete justice in the
Page 35 of 36matter, this Court considers it appropriate to invoke
the powers conferred by Article 142 of the
Constitution. As a Court exercising lawful
jurisdiction for the assigned roster, no impediment
is seen for exercise of plenary power in the present
matter. Therefore while according approval for the
ongoing CBI investigation, if any other case is
registered on the death of the actor Sushant Singh
Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his
unnatural death, the CBI is directed to investigate
the new case as well. It is ordered accordingly.
42. Before parting, it is made clear that the
conclusion and observations in this order is only for
disposal of this petition and should have no bearing
for any other purpose.
43. The Transfer Petition is disposed of with the
above order.
