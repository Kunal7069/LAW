In view of the deposit made by the appellants, the
appellant herein made a request to release the deposited
compensation amount to him as, he is the father of the
deceased victim. Such request for release of the amount
as prayed by the appellant, is rejected vide impugned
order dated 9.12.2019. Hence these appeals.4
Crl.A.Nos. @ SLP(Crl.) D.No.13225 of 2020
7. We have heard learned counsel for the appellant and
learned counsel appearing for respondent-State. Learned
counsel Sri Divyesh Pratap Singh, appearing for the
appellant, has submitted that the son of the appellant
is the victim of custodial torture, who has succumbed to
injuries suffered in lock up. It is stated that the
appellant is about 76 years of age and has been fighting
alone this case for the last more than 14 years.
Further he has, stated that on account of the
unfortunate incident, appellant has lost his son at the
young age of 20 years and further the appellant has
spent more than 14 years for pursuing the case, which
resulted in deterioration of his mental and physical
health. By further referring to material placed on
record, it is submitted that the appellant is suffering
from serious ailments and is in dire need of money for
his medical needs, and inspite of the same, the High
Court has refused to release the compensation awarded to
the appellant.
8. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for
the respondents has submitted that the judgment of the
Trial Court dated 14.03.2019 convicting the respondents
and further the order dated 20.03.2019 imposing sentence
and award of compensation, are the subject matter of5
Crl.A.Nos. @ SLP(Crl.) D.No.13225 of 2020
challenge in the appeals, as such the appellant is not
entitled for release of, such compensation, during the
pendency of the appeals before the High Court.
9. Having heard learned counsel for the appellant and
learned counsel appearing for respondent-State, we have
perused the impugned order and other material placed on
record.
10. In view of the pendency of criminal appeals before
the High Court, wherein the respondents-accused have
challenged their conviction and sentence imposed, we do
not wish to record any finding on merits of the matter.
But suffice it to say, that the compensation awarded in
the order dated 20.03.2019 is in exercise of power under
Section 357(3) Cr.P.C. 1973 and as the order dated
20.03.2019 is under challenge in criminal appeals
pending before the High Court, we are of the considered
view that it is not desirable to release such
compensation in favour of the appellant, at this stage.
It is true that, the incident has happened in the year
2006 and the appellant herein who is the father of the
victim is relentlessly pursuing the matter from last
more than a decade. But at the same time it is to be
kept in mind that, the conviction recorded and sentence
imposed by the Trial Court is the subject matter of the6
Crl.A.Nos. @ SLP(Crl.) D.No.13225 of 2020
appeals, pending before the High Court. If we permit
the release of such compensation to the appellant at
this stage, it may lead to multiplicity of proceedings.
Instead of ordering release of compensation to the
appellant at this stage, we deem it appropriate to
request the High Court for expeditious disposal of
Criminal Appeal Nos. 537 of 2019, 624 of 2019, 622 of
2019, 488 of 2019 and 499 of 2019.
11. For the aforesaid reasons, we decline to interfere
with the impugned order dated 09.12.2019 passed by the
High Court and we request the High Court to dispose of
Criminal Appeal Nos. 537 of 2019, 624 of 2019, 622 of
2019, 488 of 2019 and 499 of 2019 as expeditiously as
possible, preferably within a period of six months, from
the date of this order. The appeals are accordingly
dismissed.
