REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO. 6438 OF 2019
(ARISING OUT OF SLP (CIVIL) NO. 11110 OF 2018)
MUSTAFA .....APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. .....RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
HEMANT GUPTA, J.
1) Leave granted.
2) The owner of seized truck is in appeal aggrieved against an order
passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad on October 30,
2017, whereby the order passed by the Collector on 12.11.2016
and by the District Judge on 3.8.2017 confiscating the Vehicle for
violation of Sections 60 and 72 of the United Provinces Excise Act,
19101, remained unsuccessful.
3) An FIR was lodged on November 17, 2015 for the offences under
Sections 60 and 72 of the Act and Sections 420, 467, 468 and 471
of the Indian Penal Code, 18602 in respect of seizure of 154 cartons
of illicit liquor, one .315 bore country made pistol with two .315
bore live cartridges, by a team of Excise Department and the Police
1 for short, ‘Act’
2 for short, ‘IPC’
Page 1 of 21Officials. The investigation was taken up by Mr. Satyaveer Singh,
Sub-Inspector.
4) On December 17, 2015, a notice was served upon the appellant by
the District Magistrate, who is also the Collector of the District to
show cause as to why the seized truck be not confiscated. The
show cause notice in respect of the Santro Car meant for Nisar
Ahmed son of Nazir was issued as to why the car be not
confiscated.
5) On an application filed by Nisar Ahmed, the Chief Judicial
Magistrate, Muzaffarnagar on March 15, 2016 passed an order of
release of Santro Car.
6) The appellant filed objections before the District Magistrate on
September 23, 2016 in response to the show cause notice served
on him wherein the appellant sought release of the Vehicle as it is
sole means of his livelihood and that he will suffer financial loss. In
pursuance of such show cause notice, the District Magistrate
passed an order of confiscation and auction of both vehicles,
owned by Nisar Ahmed and the Appellant, and the sale proceeds
be deposited in Government treasury. However, the appellant was
given an option in terms of Section 72 of the Act to pay
Rs.4,50,000/- as market value of the truck. Nisar was given an
option to pay Rs.1,20,000/- to seek release of the car.
7) The appellant filed an appeal before the learned District Judge, a
Page 2 of 21judicial authority appointed by the State Government, which was
dismissed on August 3, 2017. Further, challenge to the said order
remained unsuccessful before the High Court vide the order
impugned in the present appeal.
8) The High Court held that in terms of Section 5 of the Criminal
Procedure Code, 19733, the Act is special and local Act to deal with
the properties seized under the Act, therefore, the provisions
contained in the Code with regard to disposal of property can be
used only to the extent they are not inconsistent with Section 72 of
the Act. The High Court relied upon an order passed by this Court
in State (NCT of Delhi) v. Narender4.
9) Ms. Preetika Dwivedi, learned counsel for the appellant has
vehemently argued that since FIR has been registered in respect of
transportation of illicit liquor, therefore, the Magistrate who is
competent to conduct trial alone is competent to pass an order of
release of vehicle. It is on completion of the trial; the Magistrate
will pass an order of confiscation of the vehicle. Thus, it is argued
that the Collector has no jurisdiction to pass an order of
confiscation of the vehicle. Reliance is placed upon judgment in
State of Madhya Pradesh & Ors. v. Madhukar Rao5. It is also
argued that judgment in Narender is not applicable to the facts of
the present case, as in the aforesaid case, the jurisdiction of all
courts was specifically excluded but that is not the situation in the
3 for short, ‘Code’
4 (2014) 13 SCC 100
5 (2008) 14 SCC 624
Page 3 of 21present case.
10) On the other hand, Mr. Tanmaya Agarwal, learned counsel for the
respondents argued that confiscation of a vehicle is an
independent proceeding, independent of prosecution of the
offences under the IPC. The confiscation of the vehicle engaged in
transportation of illicit liquor exclusively falls within the jurisdiction
of the Collector in terms of the various provisions of the Act.
Learned counsel relied upon judgment in Yogendra Kumar
Jaiswal & Ors. v. State of Bihar & Ors.6 as also in The State of
Madhya Pradesh v. Uday Singh7.
11) Before we consider respective arguments of the learned counsel
for the parties, some of the provisions from the Act would be
necessary to reproduce to appreciate the arguments. Chapter IX of
the Act confers power on the authorised officers of the Excise
Department and the competent Police Officers to investigate into
the offences punishable under the Act. Section 50 of the Act
confers power of arrest, seizure and detention on the specified
Excise and Police Officers whereas Chapter X deals with offences
and penalties which can be imposed for the violation of the
provisions of the Act. Section 72 of the Act deals with the things
which are liable for confiscation. The relevant provisions read as
under: -
“49. Powers of certain officers to investigate into
offences punishable under this Act. - (1) A police
6 (2016) 3 SCC 183
7 AIR 2019 SC 1597
Page 4 of 21officer not below the rank of Sub-Inspector and an
officer of the Excise Department not below such rank as
the State Government may prescribe, may investigate
into any offence punishable under this Act committed
within the limits of the area in which such officer
exercises jurisdiction.
(2) Any such officer may exercise the same powers in
respect of such investigation as an officer in charge of a
police station may exercise in a cognizable case under
the provisions of Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1973, and if specially empowered in that
behalf by the State Government, such officer may,
without reference to a Magistrate, and for reasons to be
recorded by him in writing, stop further proceedings
against any person concerned or supposed to be
concerned in any offence punishable under this Act into
which he has investigated.
50. Power of arrest, seizure and detention. - Any
officer of the excise, police, salt, opium or land revenue
department not below such rank and subject to such
restrictions as the State Government may prescribe,
and any other person duly empowered in this behalf,
may arrest without warrant any person found
committing an offence punishable under Section 60,
Section 62, Section 63 or Section 65; and may seize and
detain any intoxicant or other article which he has
reason to believe to be liable to confiscation under this
Act or other law for the time being in force relating to
excise revenue; and may detain and search any person
upon whom, and any vessel, vehicle, animal, package,
receptacle or covering in or upon which he may have
reasonable cause to suspect any such article to be.
xx xx xx
70. Cognizance of offence. - (1) No Magistrate shall
take cognizance-
(a)of an offence punishable under Section 60, Section
63, Section 64-A, Section 65 except on his own
knowledge or suspicion or on the complaint or report
of an Excise Officer; or
(b)of an offence punishable under Section 64, Section
66, Section 67 or Section 68 except on the complaint
or report to the Collector or an Excise Officer
Page 5 of 21authorised by him by a general or special order in
that behalf.
(2) Except with the special sanction of the State
Government no magistrate shall take cognizance of any
offence punishable under this Act, unless the
prosecution is instituted within a year after the date on
which the offence is alleged to have been committed.
xx xx xx
72. What things are liable to confiscation. - (1)
Whenever an offence punishable under this Act has
been committed-
(a) every intoxicant in respect of which such offence
has been committed;
(b) every still, utensil, implement or apparatus and all
materials by means of which such offence has been
committed;
(c) every intoxicant lawfully imported, transported,
manufactured, held in possession or sold along with
or in addition to any intoxicant liable to confiscation
under clause (a);
(d) every receptacle, package and covering in which
any intoxicant as aforesaid or any materials, still,
utensil, implement or apparatus is or are found,
together with the other contents (if any) of such
receptacle or package;
(e) every animal, cart, vessel or other conveyance used
in carrying such receptacle or package shall be
liable to confiscation.
(2) Where anything or animal is seized under any
provision of this Act and the Collector is satisfied for
reasons to be recorded that an offence has been
committed due to which such thing or animal has
become liable to confiscation under sub-section (1), he
may order confiscation of such thing or animal “whether
or not a prosecution for such offence has been
instituted”:
Provided that in the case of anything (except an
intoxicant) or animal referred to in sub-section (1), the
owner thereof shall be given an option to pay in lieu of
Page 6 of 21its confiscation such fine as the Collector thinks
adequate not exceeding its market value on the date of
its seizure.
(3) Where the Collector on receiving report of seizure
or on inspection of the seized things, including any
animal, cart, vessel or other conveyance, is of the
opinion that “any such things or animal is subject to
speedy wear and tear or natural decay or it is otherwise
expedient in the public interest so to do”, he may order
such things (except an intoxicant) or animal to be sold
at the market price by auction or otherwise.
(4) Where any such things or animals is sold as
aforesaid, and-
(a) no order of confiscation is ultimately passed or
maintained by the Collector under sub-section (2) or
on review under sub-section (6); or
(b) an order passed on appeal under sub-section (7) so
requires; or
(c) in the case of a prosecution being instituted for the
offence in respect of which the thing or the animal is
seized, “the order of the court so requires”;
the sale proceeds after deducting the expenses of
the sale shall be paid to the person found entitled
thereto.
(5) (a) No order of confiscation under this section shall
be made unless the owner thereof or the person from
whom it is seized is given-
(i) a notice in writing informing him of the grounds on
which such confiscation is proposed;
(ii) an opportunity of making a representation in writing
within such reasonable time as may be specified in the
notice; and
(iii) a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the
matter.
(b) Without prejudice to the provisions of clause (a), no
order confiscating any animal, cart, vessel, or other
conveyance shall be made if the owner thereof proves
to the satisfaction of the Collector that it was used in
carrying the contraband goods without the knowledge
or connivance of the owner, his agent, if any, and the
Page 7 of 21person in charge of the animal, cart, vessel or other
conveyance and that each of them had taken all
reasonable and necessary precautions against such
use.
(c) Where on an application in that behalf being made
to the Collector within one month from any order of
confiscation made under sub-section (2), or as the case
may be, after issuing notice on his own motion within
one month from the order under the sub-section
refusing confiscation to the owner of the thing or animal
seized or to the person from whose possession it was
seized, to show cause why the order should not be
reviewed, and after giving him a reasonable opportunity
of being heard, the Collector is satisfied that the order
suffers from a mistake apparent on the face of the
record including any mistake of law, he may pass such
order on review as he thinks fit.
(6) Where on an application in that behalf being made
to Collector within one month from any order of
confiscation made under sub-section (2), or as the case
may be, after issuing notice on his own motion within
one month from the order under the sub-section
refusing confiscation to the owner of the thing or animal
seized or to the person from whose possession it was
seized to show cause why the order should not be
reviewed, and after giving him a reasonable opportunity
of being heard, the Collector is satisfied that the order
suffers from the mistake apparent on the face of the
record including any mistake of law, he may pass such
order on review as he thinks fit.
(7) Any person aggrieved by an order of the
confiscation under subsection (2) or sub-section (6)
may, within one month from the date of the
communication to him of such order, appeal to such
judicial authority as the State Government may appoint
in this behalf and the judicial authority shall, after
giving an opportunity to the appellant to be heard, pass
such order as it may think fit, confirming, modifying or
annulling the order appealed against.
(8) Where a prosecution is instituted for the offence in
relation to which such confiscation was ordered the
thing or animal “shall subject to the provisions of sub-
section (4) be disposed of in accordance with the order
of the Court”.
Page 8 of 21(9) No order of confiscation made by the Collector
under this section shall prevent the infliction of any
punishment to which the person affected thereby may
be liable under this Act.”
(emphasis supplied)
12) The argument of learned counsel for the appellant is based upon
the expression “order of the court so requires” appearing in Section
72(4)(c) of the Act. Reliance is also placed on the language used in
sub-section (8) of Section 72 of the Act contemplating that where a
prosecution is instituted for an offence in relation to which such
confiscation was ordered, the thing or animal shall be disposed of
in accordance with the order of the court subject to the provisions
of sub-section (4). However, we do not find any merit in the
arguments raised.
13) Under the Act, an Officer of the Excise Department not below the
rank as the State Government may prescribe has been granted the
power to investigate; to arrest and detain any intoxicant or other
article which he has reason to believe to be liable to confiscation
under the Act. Therefore, the power of an Excise Officer is in
addition to power conferred on the Police Officer to investigate, to
seize articles and vehicles involved in the commission of crime. In
terms of Section 70 of the Act, no Magistrate can take cognizance
except on his own knowledge or suspicion or on the complaint or
report of the Excise Officer. The cognizance can also be taken on
the complaint or report to the Collector or an Excise Officer
authorised by him by general or special order. Sub-section (2) of
Page 9 of 21Section 70 of the Act categorically puts an embargo that the
Magistrate cannot take cognizance without special sanction of the
State Government and unless the prosecution is instituted within a
year.
14) Section 72(1) of the Act confers power of confiscation of animal,
cart, vessel or other conveyance used by means of which an
offence has been committed. Sub-section (2) of Section 72 of the
Act confers power upon the Collector to order confiscation of such
thing or animal “whether or not a prosecution for such offence has
been instituted”. Therefore, the power of the Collector to
confiscate the seized thing or animal is independent of
prosecution. This Court in Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal was dealing
with the confiscation of property under the Orissa Special Courts
Act, 2006 and the Bihar Special Courts Act, 2009. It was held that
such confiscation is independent of result of prosecution under the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The Court held as under:
“146. In the case at hand, the entire proceeding is
meant to arrive at the conclusion whether on the basis
of the application preferred by the Public Prosecutor and
the material brought on record, the whole or any other
money or some of the property in question has been
acquired illegally and further any money or property or
both have been acquired by the means of the offence.
After arriving at the said conclusion, the order of
confiscation is passed. The order of confiscation is
subject to appeal under Section 17 of the Orissa Act.
That apart, it is provided under Section 19 where an
order of confiscation made under Section 15 is modified
or annulled by the High Court in appeal or where the
person affected is acquitted by the Special Court, the
money or property or both shall be returned to the
person affected. Thus, it is basically a confiscation
Page 10 of 21which is interim in nature. Therefore, it is not a
punishment as envisaged in law and hence, it is difficult
to accept the submission that it is a pre-trial
punishment and, accordingly, we repel the said
submission.
xx xx xx
149. We have already held that confiscation is not a
punishment and hence, Article 20(1) is not violated. The
learned counsel for the State would lay stress on the
decision in State of A.P. v. Gandhi [State of
A.P. v. Gandhi, (2013) 5 SCC 111: (2013) 2 SCC (Cri)
884]. In that case, the issue that arose for consideration
was: when the disciplinary proceeding was initiated one
type of punishment was imposable and when the
punishment was imposed due to amendment of rule, a
different punishment, which was a greater one, was
imposed. The High Court opined that the punishment
imposed under the amended rule amounted to
imposition of two major penalties which was not there
in the old rule. Dealing with the issue the Court referred
to the rule that dealt with major penalties and the rule-
making power. Reference was made to the decision
in Pyare Lal Sharma v. J&K Industries Ltd. [Pyare Lal
Sharma v. J&K Industries Ltd., (1989) 3 SCC 448 : 1989
SCC (L&S) 484] wherein it has been stated that no one
can be penalised on the ground of a conduct which was
not penal on the date it was committed. Thereafter, the
two-Judge Bench referred to the authority in K. Satwant
Singh v. State of Punjab [K. Satwant Singh v. State of
Punjab, AIR 1960 SC 266 : 1960 Cri LJ 410] wherein it
has been held thus: (Gandhi case [State of
A.P. v. Gandhi, (2013) 5 SCC 111 : (2013) 2 SCC (Cri)
884] , SCC pp. 133-34, para 46)
“46. … ‘28. … In the present case a sentence of
imprisonment was, in fact, imposed and the total
of fines imposed, whether described as ‘ordinary’
or ‘compulsory’, was not less than the amount of
money procured by the appellant by means of his
offence. Under Section 420 of the Penal Code an
unlimited amount of fine could be imposed.
Article 20(1) of the Constitution is in two parts.
The first part prohibits a conviction of any person
for any offence except for violation of law in force
at the time of the commission of the act charged
as an offence. The latter part of the article
Page 11 of 21prohibited the imposing of a penalty greater than
that which might have been inflicted under the
law in force at the time of the commission of the
offence. The offence with which the appellant had
been charged was cheating punishable under
Section 420 of the Penal Code which was
certainly a law in force at the time of the
commission of the offence. The sentence of
imprisonment which was imposed upon the
appellant was certainly not greater than that
permitted by Section 420. The sentence of fine
also was not greater than that which might have
been inflicted under the law which had been in
force at the time of the commission of the
offence, as a fine unlimited in extent could be
imposed under the section.’” (K. Satwant Singh
case [K. Satwant Singh v. State of Punjab, AIR
1960 SC 266 : 1960 Cri LJ 410] , AIR p. 275, para
28)”
15) Recently, this Court in Uday Singh referred to earlier judgments of
this Court in State of Madhya Pradesh and Others v. Kallo
Bai8 and Divisional Forest Officer and Another v. G. V.
Sudhakar Rao and Others9 to approve the argument that
criminal proceedings are distinct from confiscation proceedings.
The Court held as under:
“22. In 2017, a similar view has been taken by another
two judge Bench of this Court in Kallo Bai (supra) while
construing the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Van
Upaj (Vyapar Viniyam) Adhiniyam, 1969. By virtue of
the amendments made to the Adhiniyam, Sections 15-A
to 15-D were introduced to provide for confiscation
proceedings in line with the provisions contained in the
Forest Act as amended in relation to the State of
Madhya Pradesh. Relying on the earlier decisions of this
8 (2017) 14 SCC 502
9 (1985) 4 SCC 573
Page 12 of 21Court including GV Sudhakar Rao (supra), Justice NV
Ramana, speaking for the two judge Bench held:
“23. Criminal prosecution is distinct from
confiscation proceedings. The two proceedings are
different and parallel, each having a distinct
purpose. The object of confiscation proceeding is
to enable speedy and effective adjudication with
regard to confiscation of the produce and the
means used for committing the offence while the
object of the prosecution is to punish the offender.
The scheme of the Adhiniyam prescribes an
independent procedure for confiscation. The
intention of prescribing separate proceedings is to
provide a deterrent mechanism and to stop further
misuse of the vehicle.”
16) The proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 72 of the Act gives an
option to the owner to pay such fine as the Collector thinks
adequate not exceeding its market value in lieu of its confiscation.
It, thus, transpires that it is the Collector who has been conferred
exclusive jurisdiction to order confiscation of a thing or animal.
The Collector has been further empowered to impose fine not
exceeding the market value of the thing on the date of seizure.
Thus, the power of confiscation of a vehicle or a thing is absolutely
vested with the Collector except in certain circumstances, instead
of confiscation, the fine, not exceeding the market value, can also
be imposed but by the Collector alone.
17) Sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act is exception to sub-section
(2) wherein, on receiving report of seizure or on inspection of the
seized things, including any animal, cart, vessel or other
Page 13 of 21conveyance, which are subject to speedy wear and tear or natural
decay or it is expedient in public interest to do so, the Collector
may order such things or animal, except an intoxicant, to be sold
by auction or otherwise. Therefore, in case any seized thing is
subject to speedy wear and tear or natural decay, the Collector is
empowered to sell the same by public auction. The power to sell
the thing or animal pending confiscation proceedings is also
contemplated if it is expedient in public interest to do so. Such
provision empowers the Collector to order the sale of the vehicle or
animal if he is satisfied that it is expedient in public interest even
before an order of confiscation is passed by him.
18) The distribution of sale proceeds after the thing or animal is sold, is
contemplated by sub-section (4) of Section 72 of the Act. It deals
with a situation when no order of confiscation is ultimately passed
or maintained by the Collector or an order passed on appeal under
sub-section (7) so requires. Similar power is conferred to distribute
the sale proceeds in terms of the order of the Court in case of a
prosecution instituted for the offence in respect of thing or animal
seized. Thus, sub-section (4) deals with the disposal of sale
proceeds of the seized thing or Animal in terms of sub-section (3)
of Section 72 of the Act. In other words, the sale conducted by
auction or otherwise in terms of sub-section (3) is complete but the
distribution of proceeds of sale alone is to be dealt with in the
manner prescribed in sub-section (4) of Section 72 of the Act
including an order of the Court dealing with prosecution instituted
Page 14 of 21for the offence.
19) Sub-section (5) of Section 72 of the Act deals with the procedure
and the limitations on the power of the Collector to sell the seized
thing including any animal, cart, vessel or other conveyance in
terms of sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act. Sub-section (6) of
Section 72 of the Act confers power of review on the Collector of an
order passed under sub-section (2).
20) Sub-section (7) of Section 72 of the Act confers a right of appeal to
a judicial authority, as the State Government may appoint, against
an order of confiscation under sub-section (2) or sub-section (6) of
Section 72 of the Act. In other words, an order of confiscation,
other than in respect of seized things which are subject to speedy
wear and tear or natural decay falling in sub-section (3) of Section
72 of the Act, is subject to appeal to the judicial authority. No
appeal is provided in respect of an order passed under sub-section
(3) of Section 72 of the Act in respect of seized things or animal
which are subject to speedy wear and tear or natural decay or
otherwise expedient in the public interest.
21) We find that in terms of Section 4 of the Code, trial of offences
under IPC are to be investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise
dealt with according to the provisions contained in the Code. It
further provides that all offences under any other law shall be
investigated, inquired into, tried, and otherwise dealt with
according to the same provisions, but subject to any enactment for
Page 15 of 21the time being in force regulating the manner or place of
investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise dealing with such
offences. The offences under the Act in terms of sub-section (2) of
Section 4 of the Code are to be dealt with according to the
provisions of the Code but subject to the provisions of the Act
regulating the manner or place of investigating, inquiring into,
trying or dealing with such offences. Since the procedure of
confiscation of the vehicle is prescribed under the Act, it is the
provision of the Act which will be applicable and not Chapter XXXIV
of the Code. Section 5 of the Code saves special or local laws or
any special jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special form of
procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force.
22) However, where a prosecution is instituted for an offence in
relation to which confiscation was ordered, the things or animals
are to be disposed of in accordance with the order of the Court
subject to provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 72 of the Act.
The order passed by the Court where a prosecution is instituted for
the offence, in terms of sub-section (8) of Section 72 of the Act, is
subject to provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 72 of the Act.
Thus, the provision again deals with distribution of the sale
proceeds after confiscation on conclusion of prosecution.
23) The power of release of the property produced before any criminal
court whether interim or final in terms of Sections 451, 452 or 457
of the Code will not be available to court except the order in
Page 16 of 21respect of distribution of sale proceeds. Therefore, the power
under Sections 451, 452 or 457 of the Code available to criminal
court or Magistrate is inconsistent with the provisions contained in
the Act regarding disposal of the property not only in respect of
pending trial but also after the conclusion of the trial.
24) The argument raised that the judgment in Narender is not
applicable to the present case cannot be accepted as the criminal
court before whom the prosecution is lodged, will not have
jurisdiction to release anything or animal whether interim or final
as the Act in question has provisions contrary to the provisions
contained in the Code. This Court in Narender relied upon the
judgment in State of Karnataka v. K. A. Kunchindammed10 and
held as under:
“13. In our opinion, the general provision of Section 451
of the Code with regard to the custody and disposal of
the property or for that matter by destruction,
confiscation or delivery to any person entitled to
possession thereof under Section 452 of the Code or
that of Section 457 authorising a Magistrate to make an
order for disposal of property, if seized by an officer and
not produced before a criminal court during an inquiry
or trial, however, has to yield where a statute makes a
special provision with regard to its confiscation and
disposal.
14. We have referred to the scheme of the Act and from
that it is evident that the vehicle seized has to be
produced before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn
has been conferred with the power of its confiscation or
release to its rightful owner. The requirement of
production of seized property before the Deputy
Commissioner under Section 59(1) of the Act is,
10 (2002) 9 SCC 90
Page 17 of 21notwithstanding anything contained in any other law,
and, so also is the power of confiscation. Not only this,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
any other law for the time being in force, no court, in
terms of Section 61 of the Act, has jurisdiction to make
any order with regard to the property used in
commission of any offence under the Act.
15. In the present case, the legislature has used a non
obstante clause not only in Section 59 but also in
Section 61 of the Act. As is well settled, a non obstante
clause is a legislative device to give effect to the
enacting part of the section in case of conflict over the
provisions mentioned in the non obstante clause.
Hence, Sections 451, 452 and 457 of the Code must
yield to the provisions of the Act and there is no escape
from the conclusion that the Magistrate or for that
matter the High Court, while dealing with the case of
seizure of vehicle under the Act, has any power to pass
an order dealing with the interim custody of the vehicle
on security or its release thereof.”
25) Though, Section 61 of the Delhi Excise Act, 2009 bars the
jurisdiction of all Courts but, even in the absence of similar
provisions in the Act, the principle laid down is applicable in the
present case as the Act is inconsistent with the provisions of the
Code.
26) The confiscation of a vehicle found in illicit transportation of the
liquor is an offence which can be investigated by an Excise Officer
as well as by a Police Officer. But the exclusive power of
confiscation is vested with the Collector in terms of sub-section (2)
of Section 72 of the Act. The sale proceeds of seized things or
Animal which are subject to speedy wear and tear or natural decay,
if sold, are required to be paid to the person found entitled thereto
in terms of sub-sections (4) and (8) of Section 72 of the Act.
Page 18 of 2127) Sub-section (9) of Section 72 of the Act clarifies that no order of
confiscation made by the Collector shall prevent the infliction of
any punishment to which the person affected thereby may be
liable under this Act. Thus, the punishment consequent to the
prosecution is distinct from the order of confiscation passed by the
Collector.
28) In Madhukar Rao’s case, the provisions of the Code and that of
the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 were examined. The Court
found that the use of a vehicle in the commission of an offence
under the Act, without anything else would bar its interim release
appears to be quite unreasonable. The Court held that the
provisions of Section 50 of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 and
the amendments made thereunder do not in any way affect the
Magistrate’s power to make an order of interim release of the
vehicle under Section 451 of the Code. The Court held as under:
“16. We are unable to accept the submissions. To
contend that the use of a vehicle in the commission of
an offence under the Act, without anything else would
bar its interim release appears to us to be quite
unreasonable. There may be a case where a vehicle
was undeniably used for commission of an offence
under the Act but the vehicle's owner is in a position to
show that it was used for committing the offence only
after it was stolen from his possession. In that situation,
we are unable to see why the vehicle should not be
released in the owner's favour during the pendency of
the trial.”
29) We find that sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act confers
power on the Collector for release of the vehicle if it is considered
Page 19 of 21expedient in public interest apart from the fact, when anything or
animal is subject to speedy wear and tear or natural decay.
Therefore, the basis of the order in Madhukar Rao are not
applicable in the case in hand.
30) After examining the provisions of the Act, we hold that the
Collector has exclusive jurisdiction to confiscate the vehicles and
in case the seized things are subject to speedy wear and tear or
natural decay, he may order to sell the same in the manner
prescribed under sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act. Sub-
section (4) deals with distribution of sale proceeds when the
seized thing is sold which is subject to wear and tear and natural
decay or when it is expedient in public interest to do so. Sub-
section (8) of Section 72 of the Act deals with a situation where a
prosecution of an offence is instituted in relation to which
confiscation was ordered, the thing or animal shall be disposed of
subject to the provisions of sub-section (4) of Section 72 of the Act
in accordance with the order of the Court. The order of the Court
in sub-section (8) of Section 72 of the Act is after conclusion of the
prosecution which is different from the seized things which are
subject to speedy wear and tear or natural decay as contemplated
by sub-section (3) of Section 72 of the Act.
31) In view of the above, we do not find any error in the order passed
by the High Court which may warrant interference in the present
appeal. Since the High Court has decided the matter only on the
question of jurisdiction of the Collector to order confiscation, the
Page 20 of 21matter is remitted back to the High Court to exercise power of
judicial review over the order of confiscation passed by the
Collector and as affirmed by the District Judge. The appeal is
disposed of accordingly.
