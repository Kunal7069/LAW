2. These appeals, by special leave, are directed against the
judgment and order dated 27/03/2012 delivered by the
Uttarakhand High Court confirming the judgment and order of
conviction and sentence dated 08/10/1999 / 25/10/1999
passed by the Special Judge, Anti Corruption, U.P. (East),
Dehradun in C.B.I. Case No.3/90, whereby the Special Judge
convicted the appellants, inter alia, under the provisions of the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947 (for short, “Act of 1947”).
3. It is necessary to narrate the facts of the case. Appellant
M.C. Gupta was posted as Assistant Divisional Manager, New
India Assurance Company Limited (for short, “the Company”).
He was authorized by the Company to operate its Account
No.314 held with the Punjab National Bank, Civil Lines,
Moradabad. Appellant Mohan Lal Gupta was the proprietor of
M/s. Mohan Dal Mill. Account No.SSI/53 was held in the
name of M/s. Mohan Dal Mill with State Bank of India, Orai,
District Jalaun, Uttar Pradesh.
Page 23
4. On 09/07/1988, appellant M.C. Gupta issued cheque
No.QDE-800186 in the sum of Rs.1,00,200/- from the account
of the Company and asked the bank to prepare a draft of
Rs.1,00,000/- in favour of M/s. Mohan Dal Mill. Appellant
M.C. Gupta himself prepared the draft application dated
09/07/1988. The bank, accordingly, prepared a draft of
Rs.1,00,000/- on the same date and debited the amount of
cheque from the account of the Company. Appellant M.C.
Gupta himself collected the said draft from the bank and sent
it to his relative appellant - Mohan Lal Gupta at Orai, who
deposited the same on 14/07/1988 in the aforementioned
account of M/s. Mohan Dal Mill vide pay-in-slip dated
14/07/1988. Thus, appellant M.C. Gupta, in collusion with
appellant Mohan Lal Gupta, dishonestly and fraudulently
misappropriated the Company’s money, which is public
money, for wrongful gain to appellant Mohan Lal Gupta,
thereby causing corresponding losses to the Company.
Page 34
5. When the siphoning off of money came to light, a FIR was
lodged on 19/02/1990 under Section 5(2) read with Section
5(1)(c) of the Act of 1947. After investigation, C.B.I. submitted
charge-sheet against both the appellants before the Special
Judge. After perusing the evidence, the Special Judge
convicted and sentenced appellant M.C. Gupta to RI for one
year and a fine of Rs.1,000/- for offence under Section 120-B
of the IPC. He was also sentenced to RI for two years and a
fine of Rs.2,000/- for offence under Section 409 of the IPC. In
addition, he was sentenced to RI for one year and a fine of
Rs.1,000/- under Section 5(2) read with Section 5(1)(c) of the
Act of 1947. Appellant Mohan Lal Gupta was sentenced to RI
for one year and a fine of Rs.1,000/- for offence under Section
120-B of the IPC. He was also sentenced to RI for one year
and a fine of Rs.1,000/- for offence under Section 409 of the
IPC. He was also sentenced to RI for one year and a fine of
Rs.1,000/- for offence under Section 5(2) read with Section
5(1)(c) of the Act of 1947 read with Section 120-B of the IPC.
All sentences were to run concurrently. In default of payment
Page 45
of fine, the appellants were to undergo imprisonment for six
months.
6. Being aggrieved by the order of conviction and sentence,
both the appellants filed separate appeals to the High Court.
As we have already noted, by the impugned order, the appeals
were dismissed by the High Court and, hence, the present
appeals.
7. The basic submission of Mr. Amarendra Sharan and Mr.
S.K. Dubey, learned senior counsel for the appellants is based
on the fact that the Act of 1947 stood repealed by the
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short, “the New Act”).
The alleged crime took place between 9/7/1988 and
14/07/1988 and FIR was lodged in respect of the same on
19/02/1990 alleging offences under the Act of 1947. Counsel
submitted that FIR could not have been lodged for the offences
punishable under the Act of 1947, which stood repealed by the
New Act. It was urged that in fact, by reason of repeal,
proceedings under the Act of 1947 stand obliterated.
Page 56
In this connection, our attention was drawn to Section 30 of
the New Act. Sub-section 1 of Section 2 thereof provides for
repeal and saving. It states that the Act of 1947 stands
repealed. It was pointed out that Sub-section 2 of Section 30
of the New Act states that notwithstanding such repeal, but
without prejudice to the application of Section 6 of the General
Clauses Act, 1897 (for short, “the GC Act”), anything done or
any action taken or purported to have been done or taken
under or in pursuance of the Acts so repealed shall, in so far
as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of the New Act be
deemed to have been done or taken under or in pursuance of
the corresponding provisions of the New Act.
8. Counsel pointed out that nothing was done or no action
was taken in pursuance of the Act of 1947 and, therefore,
there was no question of coming to a conclusion that any
action taken could be deemed to have been taken under the
provisions of the New Act. Since no action was taken under
the Act of 1947, there was no question of saving it. Counsel
Page 67
also drew our attention to Section 6 of the GC Act which
speaks about the effect of repeal. Counsel submitted that the
instant case is not covered by any of the sub-clauses of
Section 6 of the GC Act so as to come to a conclusion that any
investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may be instituted,
continued or enforced or any penalty or punishment may be
imposed as if the repealing Act had not been passed. Counsel
submitted that, in the circumstances, the entire prosecution is
vitiated and, hence, it is necessary for this Court to quash the
proceedings and set the appellants free. Alternatively, counsel
submitted that since the amount of Rs.1,00,000/- was repaid
by the appellants before 19/02/1990 i.e. even before the FIR
was lodged, this Court should reduce the sentence of the
appellants to the sentence already undergone by them. In
support of this submission, counsel relied on Satpal Kapoor
etc . v . State of Punjab etc . 1 and Shiv Nandan Dixit v .
State of U.P . 2 . Mr. Chandhiok, learned Additional Solicitor
General, for the C.B.I. supported the impugned judgment.
1 (1996) 11 SCC 769
2 (2003) 12 SCC 636
Page 78
9. We are unable to accept the submissions of learned
counsel for the appellants. It is true that according to the
prosecution, the alleged offence took place between 9/7/1988
and 14/7/1988. The New Act came into force on 9/9/1988.
The FIR was registered against the appellants, inter alia, for
offences punishable under the Act of 1947. Charges were
framed against the appellants, inter alia, under the provisions
of the Act of 1947 and the appellants were tried and convicted
as aforesaid. Since the repeal of Act of 1947 is the major
plank of the appellants’ submissions, it is necessary to quote
Section 30 of the New Act which repealed the Act of 1947. It
reads thus:
“30.Repeal and saving:- (1) The Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1947 (2 of 1947) and the Criminal
Law Amendment Act, 1952 (46 of 1952) are hereby
repealed.
(2) Notwithstanding such repeal, but without
prejudice to the application of section 6 of
the General Clauses Act, 1897 (10 of
1897), anything done or any action taken
or purported to have been done or taken
under or in pursuance of the Acts so
repealed shall, in so far as it is not
inconsistent with the provisions of this
Page 89
Act, be deemed to have been done or
taken under or in pursuance of the
corresponding provision of this Act.”
Sub-section 1 of Section 30 makes it clear that the Act of
1947 has been repealed. Sub-section 2 of Section 30 of the
New Act says that anything done or any action taken or
purported to have been done or taken under or in pursuance
of the repealed Acts in so far as it is not inconsistent with the
New Act, shall be deemed to have been done or taken in
pursuance of the New Act. Thus, a deeming fiction is
introduced so far as action taken under the repealed Act is
concerned.
10. Sub-section 2 of Section 30 keeps the application of
Section 6 of the GC Act intact and if a situation is not covered
by Section 30, resort to Section 6 of the GC Act is open.
Section 6 of the GC Act reads thus:
“6. Effect of repeal:- Where this Act, or any
Central Act or Regulation made after the
commencement of this Act, repeals any enactment
hitherto made or hereafter to be made, then, unless a
different intention appears, the repeal shall not –
Page 910
(a) revive anything not in force or existing
at the time at which the repeal takes
effect; or
(b) affect the previous operation of any
enactment so repealed or anything
duly done or suffered thereunder; or
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or
liability acquired, accrued or incurred
under any enactment so repealed; or
(d) affect any penalty, forfeiture or
punishment incurred in respect of any
offence committed against any
enactment so repealed; or
(e) affect any investigation, legal
proceeding or remedy in respect of
any such right, privilege, obligation,
liability, penalty, forfeiture or
punishment as aforesaid,
and any such investigation, legal proceeding or
remedy may be instituted, continued or enforced,
and any such penalty, forfeiture or punishment may
be imposed as if the repealing Act or Regulation had
not been passed.”
11. In this connection, we may usefully refer to the decision
of this court in Bansidhar & Ors . V . State of Rajasthan &
Ors . 3 where this court was dealing with the question whether
3 (1989) 2 SCC 557
Page 1011
the proceedings for fixation of ceiling area with reference to the
appointed date i.e. 1/4/1966 under Chapter III-B of the
Rajasthan Tenancy Act, 1955 could be initiated and continued
after coming into force of the Rajasthan Imposition of Ceiling
on Agricultural Holdings Act which with effect from 1/1/1973
repealed Section 5(6-A) and Chapter III-B of the Rajasthan
Tenancy Act, 1955. While dealing with this question, this
court observed that when there is a repeal of a statute
accompanied by re-enactment of a law on the same subject,
the provisions of the new enactment would have to be looked
into not for the purpose of ascertaining whether the
consequences envisaged by Section 6 of the GC Act ensued or
not - but only for the purpose of determining whether the
provisions in the new statute indicate a different intention.
This court further observed that a saving provision in a
repealing statute is not exhaustive of the rights and
obligations so saved or the rights that survive the repeal. This
court quoted a paragraph from its judgment in I.T.
Page 1112
Commissioner v . Shah Sadiq & Sons 4 : (SCC p.524, para
15). It reads thus:
“… In other words whatever rights are expressly
saved by the ‘savings’ provision stand saved. But,
that does not mean that rights which are not saved
by the ‘savings’ provision are extinguished or stand
ipso facto terminated by the mere fact that a new
statute repealing the old statute is enacted. Rights
which have accrued are saved unless they are taken
away expressly. This is the principle behind Section
6(c), General Clauses Act, 1897. …”
12. Thus assuming the proceedings under the Act of 1947
initiated against the appellants cannot be saved by Section
30(2) of the New Act because no action was taken pursuant to
the Act of 1947, prior to coming into force of the New Act,
saving clause contained in Section 30 is not exhaustive.
Section 6 of the GC Act can still save the proceedings.
13. Viewed from this angle, clauses (c) and (e) of Section 6 of
the GC Act become relevant for the present case. Sub-clause
(c) says that if any Central Act repeals any enactment, the
repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability
4 (1987) 3 SCC 516
Page 1213
acquired, accrued or incurred under any enactment so
repealed. In this case, the right which had accrued to the
investigating agency to investigate the crime which took place
prior to the coming into force of the New Act and which was
covered by the Act of 1947 remained, unaffected by reason of
clause (c) of Section 6. Clause (e) says that the repeal shall
not affect any investigation, legal proceeding or remedy in
respect of any such right, privilege, obligation, liability,
penalty, forfeiture or punishment and Section 6 further states
that any such investigation, legal proceeding or remedy may
be instituted, continued or enforced and such penalty,
forfeiture or punishment may be imposed as if the repealing
Act had not been passed. Therefore, the right of C.B.I. to
investigate the crime, institute proceedings and prosecute the
appellants is saved and not affected by the repeal of Act of
1947. That is to say, the right to investigate and the
corresponding liability incurred are saved. Section 6 of the
GC Act qualifies the effect of repeal stated in sub-clauses
(a) to (e) by the words ‘unless a different intention
appears’. Different intention must appear in the repealing
Page 1314
Act (See Bansidhar). If the repealing Act discloses a
different intention, the repeal shall not result in situations
stated in sub-clauses (a) to (e). No different intention is
disclosed in the provisions of the New Act to hold that repeal
of the Act of 1947 affects the right of the investigating agency
to investigate offences which are covered by the Act of 1947 or
that it prevents the investigating agency from proceeding with
the investigation and prosecuting the accused for offences
under the Act of 1947. In our opinion, therefore, the repeal of
the Act of 1947 does not vitiate or invalidate the criminal case
instituted against the appellants and the consequent
conviction of the appellants for offences under the provisions
of the Act of 1947.
14. There is no substance in the contention that the
appellants could not have been charged under the provisions
of the Act of 1947 after its repeal. As we have already noted,
the offence is alleged to have been committed prior to the
coming into force of the New Act. When the offence was
committed, the Act of 1947 was in force. It is elementary that
Page 1415
no person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation
of a law in force at the time of commission of the act charged
as an offence nor can he be subjected to a penalty greater
than that which might have been inflicted under the law in
force at the time of the commission of the offence. Article
20(1) of the Constitution of India is clear on this point. The
appellants were, therefore, rightly charged, tried and convicted
under the provisions of the Act of 1947. We may also note
that the provisions of the New Act are more stringent than the
provisions of the Act of 1947. The appellants cannot,
therefore, be said to have been prejudiced.
15. So far as the merits of the case are concerned, in our
opinion, the guilt of the appellants is clearly established and,
hence, no interference is necessary with the impugned
judgment of the High Court which has confirmed the
conviction and sentence of the appellants.
16. That takes us to the arguments on quantum of sentence.
In Satpal Kapoor , the appellant therein was charged, inter
Page 1516
alia, under Section 5(2) of the Act of 1947. He was an angina
patient, suffering from coronary diseases requiring medical
attention. He was 60 years of age. Considering these facts,
his sentence was reduced to four months’ simple
imprisonment.
17. In Shiv Nandan Dixit , the appellants therein were
charged, inter alia, under Section 5(1)(c) read with Section 5(2)
of the Act of 1947. While considering the quantum of
sentence, this court took into account the fact that the
incident had taken place nearly 23 years ago. Considering the
fact that the appellants therein had lost their jobs and retiral
benefits; that the prolonged litigation had caused considerable
loss to them and that they had crossed 60 years of age, this
court reduced the sentence of one year RI to a period of six
months’ RI.
18. In this case, so far as appellant M.C. Gupta is concerned,
he is about 70 years’ old and is stated to be suffering from
various ailments. The crime in question took place about 24
Page 1617
years ago. In the circumstances, we are of the opinion that his
sentence of two years’ RI for offence under Section 409 of the
IPC should be reduced to one year’s RI and is accordingly
reduced. Rest of the sentences awarded to him shall remain
intact. So far as appellant Mohan Lal Gupta is concerned, he
has been sentenced to one year’s RI for offence under Section
5(2) read with Section 5(1)(c) of the Act of 1947. Considering
the fact that he was the beneficiary of the dishonest and
fraudulent misappropriation of the Company’s money, we are
not inclined to reduce his sentence. We clarify that the
sentence of fine imposed on both the appellants is confirmed.
The appeals are disposed of in the aforestated terms.
