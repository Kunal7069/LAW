These writ petitions have come up before us as a Bench
of three learned Judges of this Court referred the first
mentioned writ petition to a Constitution Bench observing
thus :
"Whether the judgment of this Court dated March
10, 1997 in Civil Appeal No.1843 of 1997 can be
regarded as a nullity and whether a writ petition
under Article 32 of the Constitution can be
maintained to question the validity of a judgment
of this Court after the petition for review of the
said judgment has been dismissed are, in our
opinion, questions which need to be considered by
a Constitution Bench of this Court."
The other writ petitions were tagged to that case.
In these cases the following question of constitutional
law of considerable significance arises for consideration :
whether an aggrieved person is entitled to any relief against a
final judgment/order of this Court, after dismissal of review
petition, either under Article 32 of the Constitution or
otherwise.
In our endeavour to answer the question, we may begin
with noticing that the Supreme Court of India is established by
Article 124 of the Constitution which specifies its jurisdiction
and powers and enables Parliament to confer further jurisdiction
and powers on it. The Constitution conferred on the Supremehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 27
Court original jurisdiction (Articles 32 and 131); appellate
jurisdiction both civil and criminal (Articles 132, 133, 134);
discretionary jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal
(Article 136) and very wide discretionary powers, in the
exercise of its jurisdiction, to pass decree or make such order as
is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter
pending before it, which shall be enforceable throughout the
territory of India in the manner prescribed (Article 142); powers
like the power to withdraw any case pending in any High Court
or High Courts to itself or to transfer any case from one High
Court to another High Court (Article 139) and to review
judgment pronounced or order made by it (Article 137).
Conferment of further jurisdiction and powers is left to be
provided by Parliament by law (Article 138). Parliament is also
enabled to confer further powers on the Supreme Court
(Articles 134(2), 139, 140). Article 141 says that the law
declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts
within the territory of India and Article 144 directs that all
authorities civil and judicial, in the territory of India, shall act in
aid of the Supreme Court. It is a Court of record and has all the
powers of such a Court including power to punish for contempt
of itself (Article 129).
Since the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of
the Constitution is invoked in these writ petitions, we shall
advert to the provisions of Article 32 of the Constitution. It is
included in Part III of the Constitution and is quoted
hereunder :
"32. Remedies for enforcement of rights
conferred by this Part. -
(1) The right to move the Supreme Court by
appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of
the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed.
(2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue
directions or orders or writs, including writs in
the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus,
prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari,
whichever may be appropriate, for the
enforcement of any of the rights conferred by
this Part.
(3) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on
the Supreme Court by clauses (1) and (2),
Parliament may by law empower any other
court to exercise within the local limits of its
jurisdiction all or any of the powers
exercisable by the Supreme Court under clause
(2).
(4) The right guaranteed by this article shall not
be suspended except as otherwise provided for
by this Constitution."
A perusal of the Article, quoted above, shows it contains
four clauses. Clause (1) guarantees the right to move the
Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement
of the rights conferred by Part III - fundamental rights. By
clause (2) the Supreme Court is vested with the power to issue
directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of
habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and
certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of
any of the rights conferred by Part III. Without prejudice to thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 27
powers of the Supreme Court in the aforementioned clauses (1)
and (2), the Parliament is enabled, by clause (3), to empower by
law any other court to exercise within the local limits of its
jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme
Court under clause (2). The constitutional mandate embodied
in clause (4) is that Article 32 shall not be suspended except as
otherwise provided for by the Constitution.
Inasmuch as the Supreme Court enforces the fundamental
rights by issuing appropriate directions, orders or writs,
including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus,
prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, it may be useful to
refer to, in brief, the characterisitics of the writs in general and
writ of certiorari in particular with which we are concerned
here. In English law there are two types of writs -- (i) judicial
procedural writs like writ of summons, writ of motion etc.
which are issued as a matter of course; these writs are not in
vogue in India and (ii) substantive writs often spoken of as high
prerogative writs like writ of quo warranto, habeas corups,
mandamus, certiorari and prohibition etc.; they are frequently
resorted to in Indian High Courts and the Supreme Court.
"Historically, prohibition was a writ whereby the royal courts of
common law prohibited other courts from entertaining matters
falling within the exclusive jurisdiction of the common law courts;
certiorari was issued to bring the record of an inferior court into
the King’s Bench for review or to remove indictments for trial in
that court; mandamus was directed to inferior courts and
tribunals, and to public officers and bodies, to order the
performance of a public duty. All three were called prerogative
writs." In England while issuing these writs, at least in theory,
the assumption was that the King was present in the King’s
Court. The position regarding the House of Lords is described
thus, "of the Court of Parliament, or of the King in Parliament
as it is sometimes expressed, the only other supreme tribunal in
this country." in Rajunder Narain Rai Vs. Bijai Govind Singh
(1836 (1) Moo. P.C. 117). They are discretionary writs but the
principles for issuing such writs are well defined. In the pre-
constitutional era the jurisdiction to issue the prerogative writs
was enjoyed only by three chartered High Courts in India but
with the coming into force of the Constitution, all the High
Courts and the Supreme Court are conferred powers to issue
those writs under Article 226 and Article 32, respectively, of
the Constitution. In regard to the writ jurisdiction, the High
Courts in India are placed virtually in the same position as the
Courts of King’s Bench in England. It is a well-settled
principle that the technicalities associated with the prerogative
writs in English Law have no role to play under our
constitutional scheme. It is, however, important to note that a
writ of certiorari to call for records and examine the same for
passing appropriate orders, is issued by a superior court to an
inferior court which certifies its records for examination.
"Certiorari lies to bring decisions of an inferior court, tribunal,
public authority or any other body of persons before the High
Court for review so that the court may determine whether they
should be quashed, or to quash such decisions. The order of
prohibition is an order issuing out of the High Court and directed
to an inferior court or tribunal or public authority which forbids
that court or tribunal or authority to act in excess of its
jurisdiction or contrary to law. Both certiorari and prohibition are
employed for the control of inferior courts, tribunals and public
authorities."
Having carefully examined the historical background and
the very nature of writ jurisdiction, which is a supervisory
jurisdiction over inferior Courts/Tribunals, in our view, onhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 27
principle a writ of certiorari cannot be issued to co-ordinate
courts and a fortiorari to superior courts. Thus, it follows that a
High Court cannot issue a writ to another High Court; nor can
one Bench of a High Court issue a writ to a different Bench of
the same High Court; much less can writ jurisdiction of a High
Court be invoked to seek issuance of a writ of certiorari to the
Supreme Court. Though, the judgments/orders of High Courts
are liable to be corrected by the Supreme Court in its appellate
jurisdiction under Articles 132, 133 and 134 as well as under
Article 136 of the Constitution, the High Courts are not
constituted as inferior courts in our constitutional scheme.
Therefore, the Supreme Court would not issue a writ under
Article 32 to a High Court. Further, neither a smaller Bench
nor a larger Bench of the Supreme Court can issue a writ under
Article 32 of the Constitution to any other Bench of the
Supreme Court. It is pointed out above that Article 32 can be
invoked only for the purpose of enforcing the fundamental
rights conferred in Part III and it is a settled position in law that
no judicial order passed by any superior court in judicial
proceedings can be said to violate any of the fundamental rights
enshrined in Part III. It may further be noted that the superior
courts of justice do not also fall within the ambit of State or
other authorities under Article 12 of the Constitution.
In Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar & Ors. vs. State of
Maharashtra & Anr. [1966 (3) SCR 744], some journalists filed
a Writ Petition in the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the
Constitution challenging an oral order passed by the High Court
of Bombay, on the Original Side, prohibiting publication of the
statement of a witness given in open court, as being violative of
Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. A Bench of nine
learned Judges of this Court considered the question whether
the impugned order violated fundamental rights of the
petitioners under Article 19(1)(a) and if so whether a writ under
Article 32 of the Constitution would issue to the High Court.
The Bench was unanimous on the point that an order passed by
this Court was not amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this
Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. Eight of the learned
Judges took the view that a judicial order cannot be said to
contravene fundamental rights of the petitioners. Sarkar,J. was
of the view that the Constitution does not contemplate the High
Courts to be inferior courts so their decisions would not be
liable to be quashed by a writ of certiorari issued by the
Supreme Court and held that this Court had no power to issue a
writ of certiorari to the High Court. To the same effect are the
views expressed by Shah and Bachawat, JJ. Though, in his
dissenting judgment Hidayatullah,J. (as he then was) held that a
judicial order of the High Court, if erroneous, could be
corrected in an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution, he,
nonetheless, opined that the impugned order of the High Court
committed breach of the fundamental right of freedom of
speech and expression of the petitioners and could be quashed
under Article 32 of the Constitution by issuing a writ of
certiorari to the High Court as subordination of the High Court
under the scheme of the Constitution was not only evident but
also logical. In regard to the apprehended consequences of his
proposition, the learned Judge observed :
"It was suggested that the High Courts might issue
writs to this Court and to other High Courts and
one Judge or Bench in the High Court and the
Supreme Court might issue a writ to another Judge
or Bench in the same Court. This is an erroneous
assumption. To begin with the High Courts cannot
issue a writ to the Supreme Court because the writhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 5 of 27
goes down and not up. Similarly, a High Court
cannot issue a writ to another High Court. The
writ does not go to a court placed on an equal
footing in the matter of jurisdiction. Where the
county court exercised the powers of the High
Court, the writ was held to be wrongly issued to it
(See : In re The New Par Consols, Limited [1898
(1) Q.B. 669]." (Emphasis supplied)
In A.R.Antulay vs. R.S.Nayak & Anr. [1988 (2) SCC
602], the question debated before a seven-Judge Bench of this
Court was whether the order dated February 16, 1984, passed
by a Constitution Bench of this Court, withdrawing the cases
pending against the appellant in the Court of Special Judge and
transferring them to the High Court of Bombay with a request
to the Chief Justice to assign them to a sitting Judge of the High
Court for holding trial from day to day. [R.S.Nayak vs.
A.R.Antulay (1984) 2 SCC 183 at 243], was a valid order. It is
relevant to notice that in that case the said order was not
brought under challenge in a petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution. Indeed, the appellant’s attempt to challenge the
aforementioned order of the Constitution Bench before this
Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, turned out to be
abortive on the view that the writ petition under Article 32,
challenging the validity of the order and judgment passed by
the Supreme Court as nullity or otherwise incorrect, could not
be entertained and that he might approach the court with
appropriate review petition or any other application which he
might be entitled to file in law. While so, in the course of the
trial of those cases the appellant raised an objection in regard to
the jurisdiction of the learned Judge of the High Court to try the
cases against him. The learned Judge rejected the objection and
framed charges against the appellant, which were challenged by
him by filing a Special Leave Petition to appeal before this
Court wherein the question of jurisdiction of the High Court to
try the cases was also raised. It was numbered as Criminal
Appeal No.468 of 1986 and was ultimately referred to a seven-
Judge Bench. By majority of 5 : 2 the appeal was allowed and
all proceedings in the cases against the appellant before the
High Court pursuant to the said order of the Constitution Bench
dated February 16, 1984, were set aside and quashed.
Mukharji, Oza and Natarajan, JJ. took the view that the earlier
order of this Court dated February 16, 1984 which deprived the
appellant of his constitutional rights, was contrary to the
provisions of the Act of 1952 and was in violation of the
principles of natural justice and in the background of the said
Act was without any precedent and that the legal wrong should
be corrected ex debito justitiae Ranganath Misra,J., with whom
Ray,J., agreed, while concurring with the majority, observed
that it was a duty of the Court to rectify the mistake by
exercising inherent powers. Ranganathan,J. expressed his
agreement with the view of the majority that the order was bad
being in violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
However, he held that the said order was not one such order as
to be recalled because it could not be said to be based on a view
which was manifestly incorrect, palpably absurd or patently
without jurisdiction. In that he agreed with Venkatachaliah,J.
(as he then was) who gave a dissenting opinion. The learned
Judge held that it would be wholly erroneous to characterise the
directions issued by a five-Judge Bench as a nullity liable to be
ignored and so declared in a collateral attack. However, five
learned Judges were unanimous that the Court should act ex
debito justitiae. On the question of power of the Supreme
Court to review its earlier order under its inherent powers
Mukharji, Oza and Natarajan,JJ. expressed the view that thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 6 of 27
Court could do so even in a petition under Articles 136 or
Article 32 of the Constitution. Ranganath Misra,J. gave a
dissenting opinion holding that the appeal could not be treated
as a review petition. Venkatachaliah,J. (as he then was) also
gave a dissenting opinion that inherent powers of the Court do
not confer or constitute a source of jurisdiction and they are to
be exercised in aid of a jurisdiction that is already invested for
correcting the decision under Article 137 read with Order XL
Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules and for that purpose the
case must go before the same Judges as far as practicable.
On the question whether a writ of certiorari under Article
32 of the Constitution could be issued to correct an earlier order
of this Court Mukharji and Natarajan,JJ. concluded that the
powers of review could be exercised under either Article 136 or
Article 32 if there had been deprivation of fundamental rights.
Ranganath Misra, J. (as he then was) opined that no writ of
certiorari was permissible as the Benches of the Supreme Court
are not subordinate to the larger Benches of this Court. To the
same effect is the view expressed by Oza, Ray, Venkatachaliah
and Ranganathan,JJ. Thus, in that case by majority of 5 : 2 it
was held that an order of the Supreme Court was not amenable
to correction by issuance of a writ of certiorari under Article 32
of the Constitution.
In Smt. Triveniben vs. State of Gujarat [1989 (1) SCC
678], speaking for himself and other three learned Judges of the
Constitution Bench, Oza, J., reiterating the same principle,
observed :
"It is well settled now that a judgment of court can
never be challenged under Articles 14 or 21 and
therefore the judgment of the court awarding the
sentence of death is not open to challenge as
violating Article 14 or Article 21 as has been laid
down by this Court in Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar
vs. State of Maharashtra and also in A.R.Antulay
vs. R.S.Nayak, the only jurisdiction which could
be sought to be exercised by a prisoner for
infringement of his rights can be to challenge the
subsequent events after the final judicial verdict is
pronounced and it is because of this that on the
ground of long or inordinate delay a condemned
prisoner could approach this Court and that is what
has consistently been held by this Court. But it
will not be open to this Court in exercise of
jurisdiction under Article 32 to go behind or to
examine the final verdict reached by a competent
court convicting and sentencing the condemned
prisoner and even while considering the
circumstances in order to reach a conclusion as to
whether the inordinate delay coupled with
subsequent circumstances could be held to be
sufficient for coming to a conclusion that
execution of the sentence of death will not be just
and proper."
Jagannatha Shetty,J. expressed no opinion on this aspect.
We consider it inappropriate to burden this judgment
with discussion of the decisions in other cases taking the same
view. Suffice it to mention that various Benches of this Court
reiterated the same principle in the following cases :
[A.R.Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak & Anr. [1988 (2) SCC 602],
Krishna Swami vs. Union of India & Ors. [1992 (4) SCC 605],http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 7 of 27
Mohd.Aslam vs. Union of India [1996 (2) SCC 749], Khoday
Distilleries Ltd. & Anr. vs. Registrar General, Supreme Court
of India [1996 (3) SCC 114], Gurbachan Singh & Anr. vs.
Union of India & Anr. [1996 (3) SCC 117], Babu Singh Bains
& Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors. [1996 (6) SCC 565] and
P.Ashokan vs. Union of India & Anr. [1998 (3) SCC 56].
It is, however, true that in Supreme Court Bar
Association vs. Union of India & Anr. [1998 (4) SCC 409], a
Constitution Bench and in M.S.Ahlwat vs. State of Haryana &
Anr. [2000 (1) SCC 278] a three-Judge Bench, and in other
cases different Benches quashed the earlier judgments/orders of
this Court in an application filed under Article 32 of the
Constitution. But in those cases no one joined issue with regard
to the maintainability of the writ petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution. Therefore, those cases cannot be read as authority
for the proposition that a writ of certiorari under Article 32
would lie to challenge an earlier final judgment of this Court.
On the analysis of the ratio laid down in the
aforementioned cases, we reaffirm our considered view that a
final judgment/order passed by this Court cannot be assailed in
an application under Article 32 of the Constitution of India by
an aggrieved person whether he was a party to the case or not.
In fairness to the learned counsel for the parties, we
record that all of them at the close of the hearing of these cases
conceded that the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of
the Constitution cannot be invoked to challenge the validity of a
final judgment/order passed by this Court after exhausting the
remedy of review under Article 137 of the Constitution read
with Order XL Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules 1966.
However, all the learned counsel for the parties as also
the learned Attorney-General who appeared as amicus curiae,
on the notice of this Court, adopted an unusual unanimous
approach to plead that even after exhausting the remedy of
review under Article 137 of the Constitution, an aggrieved
person might be provided with an opportunity under inherent
powers of this Court to seek relief in cases of gross abuse of the
process of the Court or gross miscarriage of justice because
against the order of this Court the affected party cannot have
recourse to any other forum.
Mr.Shanti Bhushan, the learned senior counsel appearing
for the petitioner, submitted that the principle of finality of the
order of this Court had to be given a go-by and the case re-
examined where the orders were passed without jurisdiction or
in violation of the principles of natural justice, violation of any
fundamental rights or where there has been gross injustice. He
invited our attention to Order XLVII, Rule 6 of the Supreme
Court Rules, 1966 and submitted that this Court had inherent
jurisdiction and that cases falling in the aforementioned
categories should be examined under the inherent jurisdiction
of this Court. According to the learned counsel Article 129
would not be available to correct a judgment of this Court but
he pleaded that as from the order of the Apex Court no appeal
would lie, therefore, an application, by whatever name called,
which should be certified by a senior counsel in regard to
existence of permissible ground, has to be entertained on any of
the aforementioned grounds to correct a judgment of this Court.
He cited Antulay’s case, Supreme Court Bar Association’s case
and Ahlwat’s case as instances in which this Court had
corrected its earlier judgments. He advocated : (i) for oral
hearing on such an application and (ii) for hearing by a Bench
of Judges other than those who passed the order on the groundhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 8 of 27
that it would inspire confidence in the litigant public.
Mr.K.K.Venugopal, the learned senior counsel, while
adopting the arguments of Mr.Shanti Bhushan submitted that
the provisions of Order XLVII, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court
Rules, is a mere restatement of the provisions of Article 137 of
the Constitution and that the inherent jurisdiction of this Court
might be exercised to remedy the injustice suffered by a person.
He suggested that a Constitution Bench consisting of senior
judges and the judges who passed the order under challenge,
could be formed to consider the application seeking correction
of final orders of this Court. He added that to ensure that
floodgates are not opened by such a remedy, an application for
invoking the inherent power of this Court might require that it
should be certified by a senior advocate and in case of frivolous
application the petitioner could be subjected to costs. He relied
on the judgment of United States in United States of America
Vs. Ohio Power Company [1 Lawyers’ Ed. 2d 683] to show
that in every jurisdiction the courts have corrected their own
mistakes. He cited the judgment of this Court in Harbans Singh
Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. [1982 (2) SCC 101] to show
that even after the dismissal of the Review Petition the Supreme
Court reconsidered its own judgment; he pleaded for laying
down guidelines in regard to entertaining such an application.
Mr.Anil B.Divan, the learned senior counsel, submitted
that Article 129 of the Constitution declared this Court to be a
court of record so it would have inherent powers to pass
appropriate orders to undo injustice to any party resulting from
judgments of this Court. He relied on the judgment of this
Court in Supreme Court Bar Association’s case (supra) to show
that such a power was exercised by this Court and pleaded to
fashion appropriate procedure for entertaining application to
reconsider earlier judgment of this Court at the instance of an
aggrieved person to do justice to the parties.
The learned Attorney-General argued that the remedy
provided under Article 32 of the Constitution would not be
available to a person aggrieved by the final order of this Court;
he nonetheless supported the contentions urged by other learned
counsel that in case of gross miscarriage of justice, this Court
ought to exercise its inherent powers by entertaining an
application to examine the final order of this Court, even when
a review was rejected, in the rarest of the rare cases. According
to him where the order was passed without jurisdiction or in
violation of the principles of natural justice, the case would fall
in the rarest of the rare cases. He, however, contended that an
order of this Court could not be said to violate fundamental
rights conferred under Part III of the Constitution and,
therefore, on that ground no relief could be claimed. He
submitted that under Article 137 read with Order XL Rule 1 of
the Supreme Court Rules, 1966 review of an order of this Court
is provided which will be considered by the same Bench unless
the same Judges are not available by reason of demitting the
office. In regard to reconsideration of the judgment under the
inherent power of the Court he referred to the judgment of the
Federal Court in Raja Prithwi Chand Lall Choudhry etc. Vs.
Rai Bahadur Sukhraj Rai & Ors. etc. [1940 (2) FCR 78]. He
submitted that for correction of a final judgment of this Court
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or violation of principle of
natural justice, a curative petition could be entertained which
might be heard by an appropriate Bench composed of the senior
Judges as well as Judges who passed the order.
Dr.Rajiv Dhavan, the learned senior counsel, argued that
since the Supreme Court is the creature of the Constitution so
the corrective power has to be derived from the provisionshttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 9 of 27
conferring jurisdiction on the Supreme Court like Articles 32
and 129-140; such a power does not arise from an abstract
inherent jurisdiction. The corrective power must be exercised
so as to correct an injustice in a case of patent lack of
jurisdiction in a narrow sense, not in the Anisminic’s broader
sense, and gross violation of natural justice. Relying on the
judgment of House of Lords in R v Bow Street Metropolitan
Stipendiary Magistrate and others, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte
(No.2)’s case [1999 (1) All ER 577] he has submitted that this
Court has inherent power to correct its own judgment where a
party through no fault of his own has been subjected to an
unfair procedure giving scope for bias. His further contention
is that the corrective power is a species of the review power and
Articles 129, 137, Order XL Rule 5 and Order XLVII Rules 1
and 6 indicate that this Court has inherent power to set right its
own judgment. He referred to the decisions of this Court in
Antulay’s case, Supreme Court Bar Association’s case,
Ahlwat’s case and Triveniben’s case (supra) to impress upon us
that this Court has earlier exercised this power. He submitted
that the Supreme Court can also issue practice direction in that
behalf.
Mr. Ranjit Kumar, the learned senior counsel, invited our
attention to various provisions of the Constitution dealing with
different types of jurisdictions of this Court and advocated that
in case of manifest illegality and palpable injustice this Court
under its inherent powers could reconsider final judgment/order
passed by this Court. He submitted that the composition of the
Bench might include senior-most Judges along with the Judges
who passed the order, if available. It is also his submission that
while considering such curative petitions on the ground of
manifest illegality and palpable injustice, in the rarest of rare
cases, factors like the doctrine of stare decisis and the finality
and the certainty of the law declared by this Court are required
to be kept in mind. He referred to the judgment of this Court
rendered by seven learned Judges in The Keshav Mills Co.Ltd.
vs. Commissioner of Income-Tax Bombay North [1965 (2)
SCR 908], which was followed by another Bench of seven
learned Judges reported in Maganlal Chhaganlal (P) Ltd. vs.
Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay & Ors. [1974 (2)
SCC 402] and by a Bench of five learned Judges in the case of
The Indian Aluminium Co.Ltd. vs. The Commissioner of
Income-tax, West Bengal, Calcutta [1972 (2) SCC 150]. He
stressed that the power of re-consideration of an earlier decision
had to be very restricted; when the power of review is very
limited and circumscribed as is evident from the decision of the
Constitution Bench in Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal [1993
Suppl.(1) SCC 96] and the Bench of three learned Judges in
S.Nagaraj & Ors. vs. State of Karnataka & Anr. [1993 Suppl.(4)
SCC 595] and in Ramdeo Chauhan vs. State of Assam [2001
(5) SCC 714] by three learned Judges and in the case of Lily
Thomas & Ors. vs. Union of India & Ors. [2000 (6) SCC 224]
the exercise of inherent power for correcting the manifest
illegality and palpable injustice after dismissal of the review
petition has to be much narrower than the power of review.
These contentions pose the question, whether an order
passed by this Court can be corrected under its inherent powers
after dismissal of the review petition on the ground that it was
passed either without jurisdiction or in violation of the
principles of natural justice or due to unfair procedure giving
scope for bias which resulted in abuse of the process of the
Court or miscarriage of justice to an aggrieved person.
There is no gainsaying that the Supreme Court is the
Court of last resort - the final Court on questions both of fact
and of law including constitutional law. The law declared byhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 10 of 27
this Court is the law of the land; it is precedent for itself and for
all the courts/tribunals and authorities in India. In a judgment
there will be declaration of law and its application to the facts
of the case to render a decision on the dispute between the
parties to the lis. It is necessary to bear in mind that the
principles in regard to the highest Court departing from its
binding precedent are different from the grounds on which a
final judgment between the parties, can be reconsidered. Here,
we are mainly concerned with the latter. However, when
reconsideration of a judgment of this Court is sought the
finality attached both to the law declared as well as to the
decision made in the case, is normally brought under challenge.
It is, therefore, relevant to note that so much was the value
attached to the precedent of the highest court that in The
London Street Tramways Company, Limited Vs. The London
County Council [LR 1898 Appeal Cases 375], the House of
Lords laid down that its decision upon a question of law was
conclusive and would bind the House in subsequent cases and
that an erroneous decision could be set right only by an Act of
Parliament.
In Hoystead & Ors. Vs. Commissioner of Taxation [LR
1926 AC 155 at 165], Lord Shaw observed :
"Parties are not permitted to begin fresh litigations
because of new views they may entertain of the
law of the case, or new versions which they
present as to what should be a proper apprehension
by the Court of the legal result..... If this were
permitted litigation would have no end, except
when legal ingenuity is exhausted."
To the same effect is the view expressed by the Federal
Court of India in Raja Prithwi Chand Lall Choudhary’s case
(supra) placing reliance on dicta of the Privy Council in
Venkata Narasimha Appa Row vs. Court of Wards [1886 (II)
Appeal Cases 660 at 664]. Gwyer, CJ. speaking for the Federal
Court observed :
"This Court will not sit as a court of appeal from
its own decisions, nor will it entertain applications
to review on the ground only that one of the parties
in the case conceives himself to be aggrieved by
the decision. It would in our opinion be intolerable
and most prejudicial to the public interest if cases
once decided by the Court could be re-opened and
re-heard : "There is a salutary maxim which ought
to be observed by all Courts of last resort --
Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium . Its strict
observance may occasionally entail hardship upon
individual litigants, but the mischief arising from
that source must be small in comparison with the
great mischief which would necessarily result from
doubt being thrown upon the finality of the
decisions of such a tribunal as this."
In S. Nagaraj’s case (supra), an application was filed by
the State for clarification of the order passed earlier. It was
urged by the petitioner that any modification or recalling of the
order passed by this Court would result in destroying the
principle of finality enshrined in Article 141 of the
Constitution. Sahai, J. speaking for himself and for Pandian,J.
observed :
"Justice is a virtue which transcends all barriers.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 11 of 27
Neither the rules of procedure nor technicalities of
law can stand in its way. The order of the Court
should not be prejudicial to anyone. Rule of stare
decisis is adhered for consistency but it is not as
inflexible in Administrative Law as in Public Law.
Even the law bends before justice."
The learned Judge referring to the judgment of Raja Prithwi
Chand Lall Choudhury’s case (supra) further observed :
"Even when there was no statutory provision and
no rules were framed by the highest court
indicating the circumstances in which it could
rectify its order the courts culled out such power to
avoid abuse of process or miscarriage of justice."
The position with regard to conclusive nature of the
precedent obtained in England till the following practice
statement was made by Lord Gardiner, L.C. in Lloyds Bank,
Ltd. Vs. Dawson and Ors. [Note 1966 (3) All E.R. 77] on
behalf of himself and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary,
"They propose therefore to modify their present
practice and, while treating former decisions of
this House as normally binding, to depart from a
previous decision when it appears right to do so."
The principle in regard to departing from an earlier view
by the House, after the said practice statement, is reflected in
the speech of Lord Reid in Jones Vs. Secretary of State for
Social Services, Hudson Vs. Secretary of State for Social
Services (conjoined appeals) [1972 (1) All E.R. 145], who
observed:
"The old view was that any departure from rigid
adherence to precedent would weaken that
certainty. I did not and do not accept that view. It
is notorious that where an existing decision is
disapproved but cannot be overruled courts tend to
distinguish it on inadequate grounds. I do not
think that they act wrongly in so doing; they are
adopting the less bad of the only alternatives open
to them. But this is bound to lead to uncertainty
for no one can say in advance whether in a
particular case the court will or will not feel bound
to follow the old unsatisfactory decision. On
balance it seems to me that overruling such a
decision will promote and not impair the certainty
of the law.
But that certainty will be impaired unless this
practice is used sparingly. I would not seek to
categorise cases in which it should or cases in
which it should not be used. As time passes
experience will supply some guide. But I would
venture the opinion that the typical case for
reconsidering an old decision is where some broad
issue is involved, and that it should only be in rare
cases that we should reconsider questions of
construction of statutes or other documents."
In Fitzleet Estates Ltd. Vs. Cherry (Inspector of Taxes)
[1977 (3) All E.R. 996] Lord Wilberforce observed :
"My Lords, in my firm opinion, the 1966 Practice
Statement was never intended to allow and should
not be considered to allow such a course. Nothing
could be more undesirable, in fact, than to permit
litigants, after a decision has been given by thishttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 12 of 27
House with all appearance of finality, to return to
this House in the hope that a differently constituted
committee might be persuaded to take the view
which its predecessors rejected. True that the
earlier decision was by majority : I say nothing as
to its correctness or as to the validity of the
reasoning by which it was supported. That there
were two eminently possible views is shown by the
support for each by at any rate two members of the
House. But doubtful issues have to be resolved
and the law knows no better way of resolving them
than by the considered majority opinion of the
ultimate tribunal. It requires much more than
doubts as to the correctness of such opinion to
justify departing from it."
Lord Edmund-Davies observed :
"My Lords, I respectfully share your views that the
Chancery Lane decision [1966 (1) All.E.R. 1] was
correct. But even had I come to the opposite
conclusion, the circumstances adverted to are such
that I should not have thought it ’right’ to depart
from it now. To do so would have been to open
the floodgates to similar appeals and thereby to
impair that reasonable certainty in the law which
the Practice Statement [Note 1966 (3) All E.R. 77]
itself declared to be ’an indispensable foundation
upon which to decide what is the law and its
application to individual cases’."
The law existing in other countries is aptly summarised
by Aharon Barak in his treatise thus :
"The authority to overrule exists in most countries,
whether of civil law or common law tradition.
Even the House of Lords in the United Kingdom is
not bound any more by its precedents. The
Supreme Court of the United States was never
bound by its own decisions, and neither are those
of Canada, Australia, and Israel."
To what extent the principle of stare decisis binds this
Court, was considered in the case of Keshav Mills Co. Ltd.
(supra). The question before a Constitution Bench of Seven
learned Judges of this Court was : to what extent the principle
of stare decisis could be pressed into service where the power
of this Court to overrule its earlier decisions was invoked. The
Court expressed its view thus :
"When this Court decides questions of law, its
decisions are, under Article 141, binding on all
courts within the territory of India, and so, it must
be the constant endeavour and concern of this
Court to introduce and maintain an element of
certainty and continuity in the interpretation of law
in the country. Frequent exercise by this Court of
its power to review its earlier decisions on the
ground that the view pressed before it later appears
to the Court to be more reasonable, may
incidentally tend to make law uncertain and
introduce confusion which must be consistently
avoided. That is not to say that if on a subsequent
occasion, the Court is satisfied that its earlier
decision was clearly erroneous, it should hesitatehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 13 of 27
to correct the error; but before a previous decision
is pronounced to be plainly erroneous, the Court
must be satisfied with a fair amount of unanimity
amongst its members that a revision of the said
view is fully justified. It is not possible or
desirable, and in any case it would be inexpedient
to lay down any principles which should govern
the approach of the Court in dealing with the
question of reviewing and revising its earlier
decisions."
In Maganlal Chhaganlal’s case (supra), a Bench of seven
learned Judges of this Court considered, inter alia, the question
: whether a judgment of the Supreme Court in Northern India
Caterers’ case was required to be overruled. Khanna, J.
observed :
"At the same time, it has to be borne in mind that
certainty and continuity are essential ingredients of
rule of law. Certainty in law would be
considerably eroded and suffer a serious set back if
the highest court of the land readily overrules the
view expressed by it in earlier cases, even though
that view has held the field for a number of years.
In quite a number of cases which come up before
this Court, two views are possible, and simply
because the Court considers that the view not taken
by the Court in the earlier case was a better view
of the matter would not justify the overruling of
the view. The law laid down by this Court is
binding upon all courts in the country under
Article 141 of the Constitution, and numerous
cases all over the country are decided in
accordance with the view taken by this Court.
Many people arrange their affairs and large
number of transactions also take place on the faith
of the correctness of the view taken by this Court.
It would create uncertainty, instability and
confusion if the law propounded by this Court on
the basis of which numerous cases have been
decided and many transactions have taken place is
held to be not the correct law."
In the case of The Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. (supra),
the question before a Constitution Bench of five learned Judges
was : when can this Court properly dissent from a previous
view?
In regard to the effect of an earlier order of this Court
Sawant, J. speaking for the Constitution Bench observed in
Cauvery Water Distputes Tribunal’s case (supra) as follows :
"The decision of this Court on a question of law is
binding on all courts and authorities. Hence under
the said clause the President can refer a question of
law only when this court has not decided it.
Secondly, a decision given by this Court can be
reviewed only under Article 137 read with Rule 1
of Order XL of the Supreme Court Rules, 1966
and on the conditions mentioned therein. When,
further, this Court overrules the view of law
expressed by it in an earlier case, it does not do so
sitting in appeal and exercising an appellate
jurisdiction over the earlier decision. It does so in
exercise of its inherent power and only inhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 14 of 27
exceptional circumstances such as when the earlier
decision is per incuriam or is delivered in the
absence of relevant or material facts or if it is
manifestly wrong and productive of public
mischief. [See : Bengal Immunity Company Ltd.
Vs. State of Bihar (1955 (2) S.C.R. 603)]
In the cases of Ramdeo Chauhan (supra) and Lily
Thomas (supra), the question before the Court was, the scope of
the power of review of a judgment of this Court under Article
137 of the Constitution read with Section 114, Order XLVII of
the C.P.C. and Order XL Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules,
1966.
In the case of Ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No 2) (supra),
on November 25, 1998 the House of Lords by majority 3 : 2
restored warrant of arrest of Senator Pinochet who was the
Head of the State of Chile and was to stand trial in Spain for
some alleged offences. It came to be known later that one of
the Law Lords (Lord Hoffmann), who heard the case, had links
with Amnesty International (A.I.) which had become a party to
the case. This was not disclosed by him at the time of the
hearing of the case by the House. Pinochet Ugarte, on coming
to know of that fact, sought reconsideration of the said
judgment of the House of Lords on the ground of an appearance
of bias not actual bias. On the principle of disqualification of a
judge to hear a matter on the ground of appearance of bias it
was pointed out,
"The principle that a judge was automatically
disqualified from hearing a matter in his own cause
was not restricted to cases in which he had a
pecuniary interest in the outcome, but also applied
to cases where the judge’s decision would lead to
the promotion of a cause in which the judge was
involved together with one of the parties. That did
not mean that judges could not sit on cases
concerning charities in whose work they were
involved, and judges would normally be concerned
to recuse themselves or disclose the position to the
parties only where they had an active role as
trustee or director of a charity which was closely
allied to and acting with a party to the litigation.
In the instant case, the facts were exceptional in
that AI was a party to the appeal, it had been
joined in order to argue for a particular result and
the Law Lord was a director of a charity closely
allied to AI and sharing its objects. Accordingly,
he was automatically disqualified from hearing the
appeal. The petition would therefore be granted
and the matter referred to another committee of the
House for rehearing per curiam"
On the point of jurisdiction of the House to correct any
injustice in an earlier order, it was observed :
"In principle it must be that your Lordships, as the
ultimate court of appeal, have power to correct any
injustice caused by an earlier order of this House.
There is no relevant statutory limitation on the
jurisdiction of the House in this regard and
therefore its inherent jurisdiction remains
unfettered. In Cassell & Co. Ltd. v Broome
(No.2) [1972 (2) All ER 849 = 1972 AC 1136]
your Lordships varied an order for costs already
made by the House in circumstances where thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 15 of 27
parties had not had a fair opportunity to address
argument on the point."
And it was held,
"An appeal to the House of Lords will only be
reopened where a party through no fault of its own,
has been subjected to an unfair procedure. A
decision of the House of Lords will not be varied
or rescinded merely because it is subsequently
thought to be wrong."
We may notice here that in these cases except in Raja
Prithwi Chand Lall Choudhary (supra) and Ex parte Pinochet
Ugarte (No.2) (supra), the question was in what circumstances
the ratio in the earlier judgment of the highest court having
precedent value could be departed. In the aforementioned two
cases the decision was rendered on an application seeking
reconsideration of the final judgment of the Federal Court and
House of Lords respectively. In view of the specific provision
of Article 137 of the Constitution read with Order XL Rule 1 of
the Supreme Court Rules, conferring power of review on this
Court, the problem in entertaining a review petition against its
final judgment which its precursor - the Federal Court - had to
face, did not arise before this Court.
The petitioners in these writ petitions seek re-
consideration of the final judgments of this Court after they
have been unsuccessful in review petitions and in that these
cases are different from the cases referred to above. The
provision of Order XL Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules bars
further application for review in the same matter. The concern
of the Court now is whether any relief can be given to the
petitioners who challenge the final judgment of this Court,
though after disposal of review petitions, complaining of the
gross abuse of the process of Court and irremedial injustice. In
a State like India, governed by rule of law, certainty of law
declared and the final decision rendered on merits in a lis
between the parties by the highest court in the country is of
paramount importance. The principle of finality is insisted
upon not on the ground that a judgment given by the apex Court
is impeccable but on the maxium "Interest reipublicae ut sit
finis litium
At one time adherence to the principle of stare decisis
was so rigidly followed in the courts governed by the English
Jurisprudence that departing from an earlier precedent was
considered heresy. With the declaration of the practice
statement by the House of Lords, the highest court in England
was enabled to depart from a previous decision when it
appeared right to do so. The next step forward by the highest
court to do justice was to review its judgment inter partie to
correct injustice. So far as this Court is concerned, we have
already pointed out above that it has been conferred the power
to review its own judgments under Article 137 of the
Constitution. The role of judiciary merely to interpret and
declare the law was the concept of bygone age. It is no more
open to debate as it is fairly settled that the courts can so mould
and lay down the law formulating principles and guidelines as
to adapt and adjust to the changing conditions of the society,
the ultimate objective being to dispense justice. In the recent
years there is a discernable shift in the approach of the final
courts in favour of rendering justice on the facts presented
before them, without abrogating but by-passing the principle of
finality of the judgment. In Union of India and Anr. etc. Vs.http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 16 of 27
Raghubir Singh (Dead) by Lrs. etc. etc. [1989 (2) SCC 754]
Pathak, CJ. speaking for the Constitution Bench aptly
observed :
"But like all principles evolved by man for the
regulation of the social order, the doctrine of
binding precedent is circumscribed in its
governance by perceptible limitations, limitations
arising by reference to the need for re-adjustment
in a changing society, a re-adjustment of legal
norms demanded by a changed social context.
This need for adapting the law to new urges in
society brings home the truth of the Holmesian
aphorism that "the life of the law has not been
logic it has been experience"(Oliver Wendell
Holmes : The Common Law, p.5), and again when
he declared in another study (Oliver Wendell
Holmes : Common Carriers and the Common Law,
(1943) 9 Curr LT 387, 388) that "the law is forever
adopting new principles from life at one end", and
"sloughing off" old ones at the other. Explaining
the conceptual import of what Holmes had said,
Julius Stone elaborated that it is by the
introduction of new extra-legal propositions
emerging from experience to serve as premises, or
by experience-guided choice between competing
legal propositions, rather than by the operation of
logic upon existing legal propositions, that the
growth of law tends to be determined (Julius Stone
: Legal Systems & Lawyers Reasoning, pp.58-59)"
The concern of this Court for rendering justice in a cause
is not less important than the principle of finality of its
judgment. We are faced with competing principles - ensuring
certainty and finality of a judgment of the Court of last resort
and dispensing justice on reconsideration of a judgment on the
ground that it is vitiated being in violation of the principle of
natural justice or apprehension of bias due to a Judge who
participated in decision making process not disclosing his links
with a party to the case, or abuse of the process of the court.
Such a judgment, far from ensuring finality, will always remain
under the cloud of uncertainty. Almighty alone is the dispenser
of absolute justice - a concept which is not disputed but by a
few. We are of the view that though Judges of the highest
Court do their best, subject of course to the limitation of human
fallibility, yet situations may arise, in the rarest of the rare
cases, which would require reconsideration of a final judgment
to set right miscarriage of justice complained of. In such case it
would not only be proper but also obligatory both legally and
morally to rectify the error. After giving our anxious
consideration to the question we are persuaded to hold that the
duty to do justice in these rarest of rare cases shall have to
prevail over the policy of certainty of judgment as though it is
essentially in public interest that a final judgment of the final
court in the country should not be open to challenge yet there
may be circumstances, as mentioned above, wherein declining
to reconsider the judgment would be oppressive to judicial
conscience and cause perpetuation of irremediable injustice.
It may be useful to refer to the judgment of the Supreme
Court of United States in Ohio Power Company’s case (supra).
In that case the Court of Claims entered judgment for refund of
tax, alleged to have been overpaid, in favour of the tax payer.
On the application of the Government a writ of certiorari
against that judgment was declined by the Supreme Court of
United States in October 1955. The Government sought re-http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 17 of 27
hearing of the case by filing another application which was
dismissed in December 1955. A second petition for hearing
was also rejected in May 1956. However, in June 1956 the
order passed in December 1955 was set aside sua sponte (of its
own motion) and that case was ordered to be heard along with
two other pending cases in which the same question was
presented. In those two cases the Supreme Court held against
the tax payer and, on the authority of that judgment, reversed
the judgment of the Court of Claims. Four learned members of
the Court, in per curiam opinion, rested the decision "on the
ground of interest in finality of the decision must yield where
the interest of justice so required". Three learned members
dissented and held that denial of certiorari had become final and
ought not to be disturbed. Two learned members, however, did
not participate.
This Court in Harbans Singh’s case (supra), on an
application under Article 32 of the Constitution filed after the
dismissal of special leave petition and the review, reconsidered
its judgment. In that case, among others, the petitioner and
another person were convicted under Section 302 of I.P.C. and
sentenced to death. In the case of one of the remaining two
convicts, the Supreme Court commuted the death sentence to
life imprisonment. While staying the death sentence of the
petitioner, A.N.Sen, J. in his concurring opinion, noticed the
dismissal of the petitioner’s special leave, review petitions and
the petition for clemency by the President and observed :
"Very wide powers have been conferred on this
Court for due and proper administration of justice.
Apart from the jurisdiction and powers conferred
on this Court under Articles 32 and 136 of the
Constitution, I am of the opinion that this Court
retains and must retain, an inherent power and
jurisdiction for dealing with any extraordinary
situation in the larger interests of administration of
justice and for preventing manifest injustice being
done. This power must necessarily be sparingly
used only in exceptional circumstances for
furthering the ends of justice."
In Antulay’s case (supra), the majority in the seven-Judge
Bench of this Court set aside an earlier judgment of the
Constitution Bench in a collateral proceeding on the view that
the order was contrary to the provisions of the Act of 1952; in
the background of that Act without precedent and in violation
of the principles of natural justice, which needed to be corrected
ex debito justitiae.
In Supreme Court Bar Association’s case (supra), on an
application filed under Article 32 of the Constitution of India,
the petitioner sought declaration that the Disciplinary
Committees of the Bar Councils set up under the Advocates
Act, 1961, alone had exclusive jurisdiction to inquire into and
suspend or debar an advocate from practising law for
professional or other misconduct and that the Supreme Court of
India or any High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction
had no such jurisdiction, power or authority in that regard. A
Constitution Bench of this Court considered the correctness of
the judgment of this Court in Re: Vinay Chandra Mishra
[(1995) 2 SCC 584]. The question which fell for consideration
of this Court was : whether the punishment of debarring an
advocate from practice and suspending his licence for a
specified period could be passed in exercise of power of this
Court under Article 129 read with Article 142 of thehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 18 of 27
Constitution of India. There an errant advocate was found
guilty of criminal contempt and was awarded the punishment of
simple imprisonment for a period of six weeks and was also
suspended from practice as an advocate for a period of three
years from the date of the judgment of this Court for contempt
of the High Court of Allahabad. As a result of that punishment
all elective and nominated offices/posts then held by him in his
capacity as an advocate had to be vacated by him. Elucidating
the scope of the curative nature of power conferred on the
Supreme Court under Article 142, it was observed :
"The plenary powers of the Supreme Court under
Article 142 of the Constitution are inherent in the
Court and are complementary to those powers
which are specifically conferred on the Court by
various statutes though are not limited by those
statutes. These powers also exist independent of
the statutes with a view to do complete justice
between the parties. These powers are of very
wide amplitude and are in the nature of
supplementary powers. This power exists as a
separate and independent basis of jurisdiction apart
from the statutes. It stands upon the foundation
and the basis for its exercise may be put on a
different and perhaps even wider footing, to
prevent injustice in the process of litigation and to
do complete justice between the parties. This
plenary jurisdiction is, thus, the residual source of
power which the Supreme Court may draw upon as
necessary whenever it is just and equitable to do so
and in particular to ensure the observance of the
due process of law, to do complete justice between
the parties, while administering justice according
to law. It is an indispensable adjunct to all other
powers and is free from the restraint of jurisdiction
and operates as a valuable weapon in the hands of
the Supreme Court to prevent "clogging or
obstruction of the stream of justice"."
Inspite of the width of power conferred by Article 142, the
Constitution Bench took the view that suspending the advocate
from practice and suspending his licence was not within the
sweep of the power under the said Article and overruled the
judgment in Re V.C.Mishra’s case (supra).
In M.S.Ahlwat’s case (supra), the petitioner, who was
found guilty of forging signatures and making false statements
at different stages before this Court, was inflicted punishment
under Section 193 IPC in Afzal vs. State of Haryana [1996 (7)
SCC 397]. He filed an application under Article 32 of the
Constitution assailing the validity of that order. Taking note of
the complaint of miscarriage of justice by the Supreme Court in
ordering his incarceration which ruined his career, acting
without jurisdiction or without following the due procedure, it
was observed that to perpetuate an error was no virtue but to
correct it was a compulsion of judicial conscience. The
correctness of the judgment was examined and the error was
rectified.
In the cases discussed above this Court reconsidered its
earlier judgments, inter alia, under Articles 129 and 142 which
confer very wide powers on this Court to do complete justice
between the parties. We have already indicated above that the
scope of the power of this Court under Article 129 as a court of
record and also adverted to the extent of power under Articlehttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 19 of 27
142 of the Constitution.
The upshot of the discussion in our view is that this
Court, to prevent abuse of its process and to cure a gross
miscarriage of justice, may re-consider its judgments in
exercise of its inherent power.
The next step is to specify the requirements to entertain
such a curative petition under the inherent power of this Court
so that floodgates are not opened for filing a second review
petition as a matter of course in the guise of a curative petition
under inherent power. It is common ground that except when
very strong reasons exist, the Court should not entertain an
application seeking reconsideration of an order of this Court
which has become final on dismissal of a review petition. It is
neither advisable nor possible to enumerate all the grounds on
which such a petition may be entertained.
Nevertheless, we think that a petitioner is entitled to
relief ex debito justitiae if he establishes (1) violation of
principles of natural justice in that he was not a party to the lis
but the judgement adversely affected his interests or, if he was a
party to the lis, he was not served with notice of the
proceedings and the matter proceeded as if he had notice and
(2) where in the proceedings a learned Judge failed to disclose
his connection with the subject-matter or the parties giving
scope for an apprehension of bias and the judgment adversely
affects the petitioner.
The petitioner, in the curative petition, shall aver
specifically that the grounds mentioned therein had been taken
in the review petition and that it was dismissed by circulation.
The curative petition shall contain a certification by a Senior
Advocate with regard to the fulfillment of the above
requirements.
We are of the view that since the matter relates to re-
examination of a final judgment of this Court, though on
limited ground, the curative petition has to be first circulated to
a Bench of the three senior-most Judges and the Judges who
passed the judgment complained of, if available. It is only
when a majority of the learned Judges on this Bench conclude
that the matter needs hearing that it should be listed before the
same Bench (as far as possible) which may pass appropriate
orders. It shall be open to the Bench at any stage of
consideration of the curative petition to ask a senior counsel to
assist it as amicus curiae. In the event of the Bench holding at
any stage that the petition is without any merit and vexatious, it
may impose exemplary costs on the petitioner.
Insofar as the present writ petitions are concerned, the
Registry shall process them, notwithstanding that they do not
contain the averment that the grounds urged were specifically
taken in the review petitions and the petitions were dismissed in
circulation.
The point is accordingly answered.
============================================================================================
====================================
BANERJEE, J.
I have had the privilege of going through a very lucid
expression of opinion by brother Quadri and while recording myhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 20 of 27
concurrence therewith I wish to add a few paragraphs of my own.
The issue involved presently though not a concept within the
ambit of doctrine of stare decisis but akin thereto to the effect as to
the scope or finality of the decision of this Court in the normal
course of events. There cannot possibly be any manner of doubt
that the matter once dealt with by this Court attains a state of
finality and no further grievance can be had in regard thereto. The
founding fathers of the Constitution decidedly provided that the
decision of this Court as final, conclusive and binding final and
conclusive inter-parties and binding on all. But the makers have
also conferred a power of review of the Judgment of this Court and
the perusal of the provisions of Articles 137 and 145 makes it
abundantly clear. In the event, however, a party stands aggrieved
by reason of a rejection of review, the question posed as to whether
a litigant thereof to suffer the onslaught for all times to come and
in perpetuity when on the face of the Order it appears to be wholly
without jurisdiction or in violation of natural justice a further
factum of there being a bias or gross or manifest injustice, which
shocks the conscience of a reasonable man: needless to record that
the facts, as noticed above, are not only unwarranted but possibly
in the region of impossibility or more appropriately improbable
Mr. K.K.Venugopal, the learned senior counsel appearing in
support of one of the matters before this Bench, has been rather
emphatic in his submissions as regards the apprehension of bias
and it is his contention that a mere likelihood of bias should
prompt this Court to allow a further consideration of the matter.
Incidentally, be it noted that in all these matters, petitions under
Article 32 of the Constitution have been filed with a prayer for
issuance of the Writ of Certiorari. We called for the records in
some of the matters, which stand concluded by decisions of this
Court and the principal issue thus arises as to the maintainability of
a petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. There is no denial
of the fact that the right exists to move this Court for enforcement
of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution and stands
conferred in terms of Article 32 and the language used therein is of
widest possible amplitude but as regards the issuance of writs, the
view seems to be rather well settled in the negative.
About four decades ago, in Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar and
others vs. State of Maharashtra and another (1966) 3 SCR 744, a
nine Judge Bench of this Court in no uncertain terms negatived the
availability of writ jurisdiction under Article 32 and with utmost
clarity and felicity of expression stated:
"We are, therefore, satisfied that so far as the
jurisdiction of this Court to issue writ of certiorari is
concerned, it is impossible to accept the argument of
the petitioners that judicial orders passed by High
Courts in or in relation to proceedings pending before
them, are amenable to be corrected by exercise of the
said jurisdiction. We have no doubt that it would be
unreasonable to attempt to rationalise the assumption of
jurisdiction by this Court under Art. 32 to correct such
judicial orders on the fanciful hypothesis that High
Courts may pass extravagant orders in or in relation to
matters pending before them and that a remedy by way
of a writ of certiorari should, therefore, be sought for
and be deemed to be included within the scope of Art.
32. The words used in Art. 32 are no doubt wide; but
having regard to the considerations which we have set
out in the course of this judgment, we are satisfied that
the impugned order cannot be brought within the scope
of this Court’s jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari
under Art. 32; to hold otherwise would be repugnant to
the well-recognised limitations within which the
jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari can be exercisedhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 21 of 27
and inconsistent with the uniform trend of this Court’s
decisions in relation to the said point."
Two decades later, this Court in A.R.Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak
and another (1988) 2 SCC 602, relying upon the nine Judge Bench
Judgment, came to a conclusion that in view of the decision in
Mirajkar case, it must be taken as concluded that the judicial
proceedings in this Court are not subject to the writ jurisdiction
under Article 32 of the Constitution and that is so on account of the
fact that Benches of this Court are not subordinate to larger
Benches thereof and certiorari is not admissible thus for quashing
of the Orders made on the judicial side of the court. In Smt.
Triveniben vs. State of Gujarat (1989) 1 SCC 678, a Constitution
Bench of this Court also in no uncertain terms laid down that it
will not be open to this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under
Article 32 to go behind or to examine the final verdict reached by a
competent Court. To complete the list, however, a very recent
decision of this Court in Ajit Kumar Barat vs. Secretary, Indian
Tea Association and others (2001) 5 SCC 42 one of us (Shivaraj
V. Patil, J) upon consideration of Mirajkar (supra) and Antulay
(supra) came to a conclusion that authority of an Order passed by
this Court itself cannot be subjected to writ jurisdiction of this
Court.
On the wake of the aforesaid, there is thus no manner of
doubt that the plea of the availability of writ jurisdiction, as
envisaged under Article 32 of the Constitution, cannot be sustained
and the law seems to be well settled on this score and as such we
need not delve into neither dilate any further thereon.
Having regard to the conclusion, as above, does it, however,
mean and imply a closed door even if the Order of this Court
depicts that the same stands in violation of natural justice adversely
and seriously affecting the rights of the parties or the same depicts
manifest injustice rendering the order a mockery of justice can it
be said that the binding nature of an Order of this Court, cannot
thus be ever be corrected even if it causes insurmountable
difficulty and immense public injury the debate has a very large
and wide ramification and thus will have to be dealt with in a
manner with care and caution and with proper circumspection as
regards its impact - the principal basis being the concept of justice
and this is where the principle of ex debito justitiae comes to play.
Can it be said that the justice delivery system of the country is such
that in spite of noticing a breach of public interest with a
corresponding social ramification, this Court would maintain a
delightful silence with a blind eye and deaf ear to the cry of a
society in general or even that of a litigant on the ground of finality
of an Order as passed by this Court ? True the finality shall have
to be maintained but is it the principal requirement, which the law
envisages? Roscoe Pound stated that flexibility is the greatest
virtue of law and thus its applicability should also be flexible
rather than a rigid insistence on a strict format. Justice of the
situation shall have to be considered with a fair perception of such
a concept rather than with a blinking light attention ought to be
focussed on a larger social perspective since law is meant for the
society and if flexibility is its virtue, which law enjoys, its
corresponding primary duty thus would be to change the legal
horizon and perspective with the appropriate socio-economic
change. The law must follow the society rather than abandon the
society and carry on it strict track without any deviation or without
being hindered of the social changes and thus resultantly face a
social catastrophe.
Lord Denning’s exposition of the doctrine ’ex debito
justitiae’ in A/s Cathrineholm vs. Norequipment Trading Ltd.
(1972 (2) All ER 538) has been stated to be rather restrictive, buthttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 22 of 27
since basically the same stands out to be on the concept of justice,
speaking for myself do not subscribe to such a criticism. The
Master of the Rolls stated that if the Judgment is irregular that
is, which ought not to have been signed at all then the defendant
is entitled ex debito justitiae to have it set aside but in the event it
is otherwise regular, question of setting aside of the Judgment
would not arise. It is, thereafter, however, arises, the question as to
the true effect of Regular and Irregular Judgments : Since the issue
involves a much wider debate, we refrain ourselves to attribute
meanings thereto or to dilate on the ramifications of the
terminology having regard to further enunciation of the doctrine by
both the English Courts and the Indian Supreme Court.
Adverting to the true purport of the maxim, therefore, it is no
gainsaid that "the same relates to and arises from the concept of
justice : In the event there appears to be infraction of the concept,
question of there being a turn around and thereby maintaining a
total silence by the law Courts would not arise. It is on this score,
the learned Attorney General for India, appearing as Amicus
Curiae, contended that Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to
exercise this inherent power for the ends of justice or to prevent
abuse of the process of the court. Though we are not inclined to
ascribe an Order of this Court as an abuse of the process of the
Court, but the factum of the availability of inherent power for the
ends of justice cannot in any way be decried. The Constitution of
India assigned a pivotal role on to the Supreme Court providing
therein the supremacy of law with the rationale being justice is
above all. The exercise of inherent power of this Court also stands
recognised by Order XLVII Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules,
1966, which reads as below:
"6 Nothing in these rules shall be deemed to limit or
otherwise affect the inherent powers of the Court
to make such orders as may be necessary for the
ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process
of the Court."
The observations of this Court in A.R. Antulay (supra) lends
concurrence to such an exercise of power by this Court ex debito
justitiae. The Court can exercise its inherent power in the event of
there being an error brought to the notice of this Court.
Mukharji,J (as he then was) in paragraph 40 of the Judgment in
A.R. Antulay (supra) very lucidly and with utmost precision
stated:
"The question of validity, however, is important in that
the want of jurisdiction can be established solely by a
superior court and that, in practice, no decision can be
impeached collaterally by any inferior court. But the
superior court can always correct its own error brought
to its notice either by way of petition or ex debito
justitiae. See Rubinstein’s Jurisdiction and Illegality)."
Incidentally a Seven Judge Bench of this Court in Synthetics
and Chemicals Ltd. and others vs. State of U.P. and others (1990) 1
SCC 109 relied upon another Judgment of Lord Denning in Ostime
(Inspector of Taxes) vs. Australian Mutual Provident Society
(1959 (3) All ER 245 : 1960 AC 459) and the dissent noting by
Justice Jackson in the case of Commonwealth of Massachusetts et
al vs. USA (92 L ed 968), wherein in similar tone it has been
stated that as soon as one finds a journey in the wrong direction,
there should always be an attempt to turn to the right direction
since law courts ought to proceed for all times in the right path
rather than in the wrong. Adverting to the issue of inherent power,
the observations of this Court in S. Nagaraj and others vs. State of
Karnataka and another (1993 Supp. (4) SCC 595) seems to behttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 23 of 27
rather apposite. This Court in paragraph 19 of the report, upon
relying on the fundamental principles of jurisprudence that justice
is above all, stated as below:
"Review literally and even judicially means re-
examination or re-consideration. Basic philosophy
inherent in it is the universal acceptance of human
fallibility. Yet in the realm of law the courts and even
the statutes lean strongly in favour of finality of
decision legally and properly made. Exceptions both
statutorily and judicially have been carved out to
correct accidental mistakes or miscarriage or justice.
Even when there was no statutory provision and no
rules were framed by the highest court indicating the
circumstances in which it could rectify its order the
courts culled out such power to avoid abuse of process
or miscarriage of justice. In Raja Prithwi Chand Lal
Choudhury v. Sukhraj Rai (AIR 1941 FC 1,2 : 1940
FCR 78 : (1941) 1 MLJ Supp 45) the Court observed
that even though no rules had been framed permitting
the highest Court to review its order yet it was available
on the limited and narrow ground developed by the
Privy Council and the House of Lords. The Court
approved the principle laid down by the Privy Council
in Rajunder Narain Rae v. Bijai Govind Singh [(1836) 1
Moo PC 117 : 2 MIA 181 : 1 Sar 175] that an order
made by the Court was final and could not be altered:
". nevertheless, if by misprision in
embodying the judgments, by errors have
been introduced, these Courts possess, by
Common law, the same power which the
Courts of record and statute have of rectifying
the mistakes which have crept in . The
House of Lords exercises a similar power of
rectifying mistakes made in drawing up its
own judgments, and this Court must possess
the same authority. The Lords have however
gone a step further, and have corrected
mistakes introduced through inadvertence in
the details of judgments; or have supplied
manifest defects in order to enable the decrees
to be enforced, or have added explanatory
matter, or have reconciled inconsistencies.
Basis for exercise of the power was stated in the same
decision as under:
"It is impossible to doubt that the indulgence
extended in such cases is mainly owing to the
natural desire prevailing to prevent
irremediable injustice being done by a Court
of last resort, where by some accident,
without any blame, the party has not been
heard and an order has been inadvertently
made as if the party had been heard."
Rectification of an order thus stems from the
fundamental principle that justice is above all. It is
exercised to remove the error and not for disturbing
finality. When the Constitution was framed the
substantive power to rectify or recall the order passed
by this Court was specifically provided by Article 137
of the Constitution. Our Constitution-makers who had
the practical wisdom to visualise the efficacy of suchhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 24 of 27
provision expressly conferred the substantive power to
review any judgment or order by Article 137 of the
Constitution. And clause (c) of Article 145 permitted
this Court to frame rules as to the conditions subject to
which any judgment or order may be reviewed. In
exercise of this power Order XL had been framed
empowering this Court to review an order in civil
proceedings on grounds analogous to Order XLVII
Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code. The expression
’for any other sufficient reason’ in the clause has been
given an expanded meaning and a decree or order
passed under misapprehension of true state of
circumstances has been held to be sufficient ground to
exercise the power. Apart from Order XL Rule 1 of the
Supreme Court Rules this Court has the inherent power
to make such orders as may be necessary in the interest
of justice or to prevent the abuse of process of Court.
The Court is thus not precluded from recalling or
reviewing its own order if it is satisfied that it is
necessary to do so for sake of justice."
In one of its recent pronouncements [Supreme Court Bar
Association vs. Union of India and another (1998 (4) SCC 409)]
this Court has had the occasion to deal with the issue at some
length relying upon Article 129 read with Article 142 of the
Constitution. The plenary powers of the Supreme Court, as
envisaged under Article 142, stand out to be complimentary to
those powers to do complete justice between the parties and it is on
this score in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the report, this Court
observed:
"47 The plenary powers of this Court under Article
142 of the Constitution are inherent in the Court and are
complementary to those powers which are specifically
conferred on the Court by various statutes though are
not limited by those statutes. These powers also exist
independent of the statutes with a view to do complete
justice between the parties. These powers are of very
wide amplitude and are in the nature of supplementary
powers. This power exists as a separate and
independent basis of jurisdiction apart from the statutes.
It stands upon the foundation and the basis for its
exercise may be put on a different and perhaps even
wider footing, to prevent injustice in the process of
litigation and to do complete justice between the
parties. This plenary jurisdiction is, thus, the residual
source of power which this Court may draw upon as
necessary whenever it is just and equitable to do so and
in particular to ensure the observance of the due process
of law, to do complete justice between the parties,
while administering justice according to law. There is
no doubt that it is an indispensable adjunct to all other
powers and is free from the restraint of jurisdiction and
operates as a valuable weapon in the hands of the Court
to prevent "clogging or obstruction of the stream of
justice". It, however, needs to be remembered that the
powers conferred on the Court by Article 142 being
curative in nature cannot be construed as powers which
authorise the Court to ignore the substantive rights of a
litigant while dealing with a cause pending before it.
This power cannot be used to "supplant" substantive
law applicable to the case or case under consideration
of the Court. Article 142, even with the width of its
amplitude, cannot be used to build a new edifice where
none existed earlier, by ignoring express statutoryhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 25 of 27
provisions dealing with a subject and thereby to achieve
something indirectly which cannot be achieved directly.
Punishing a contemner advocate, while dealing with a
contempt of court case by suspending his licence to
practice, a power otherwise statutorily available only to
the Bar Council of India, on the ground that the
contemner is also an advocate, is, therefore, not
permissible in exercise of the jurisdiction under Article
142. The construction of Article 142 must be
functionally informed by the salutary purposes of the
article, viz., to do complete justice between the parties.
It cannot be otherwise. As already noticed in a case of
contempt of court, the contemner and the court cannot
be said to be litigating parties.
48. The Supreme Court in exercise of its jurisdiction
under Article 142 has the power to make such order as
is necessary for doing complete justice "between the
parties in any cause or matter pending before it". The
very nature of the power must lead the Court to set
limits for itself within which to exercise those powers
and ordinarily it cannot disregard a statutory provision
governing a subject, except perhaps to balance the
equities between the conflicting claims of the litigating
parties by "ironing out the creases" in a cause or matter
before it. Indeed this Court is not a court of restricted
jurisdiction of only dispute-settling. It is well
recognised and established that this Court has always
been a law-maker and its role travels beyond merely
dispute-settling. It is a "problem-solver in the nebulous
areas" (see K. Veeraswami v. Union of India (1991) 3
SCC 655 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 734) but the substantive
statutory provisions dealing with the subject-matter of a
given case cannot be altogether ignored by this Court,
while making an order under Article 142. Indeed, these
constitutional powers cannot, in any way, be controlled
by any statutory provisions but at the same time these
powers are not meant to be exercised when their
exercise may come directly in conflict with what has
been expressly provided for in a statute dealing
expressly with the subject."
Incidentally, this Court stands out to be an avenue for
redressal of grievance not only in its revisional jurisdiction as
conferred by the Constitution but as a platform and forum for
every grievance in the country and it is on this context Mr.Shanti
Bhushan, appearing in support of the some of the petitioners,
submitted that the Supreme Court in its journey for over 50 years
has been able to obtain the confidence of the people of the country,
whenever the same is required be it the atrocities of the police or
a public grievance pertaining to a governmental action involving
multitudes of problems. It is the Supreme Court, Mr. Shanti
Bhushan contended, where the people feel confident that justice is
above all and would be able to obtain justice in its true form and
sphere and this is beyond all controversies. It has been contended
that finality of the proceeding after an Order of the Supreme Court,
there should be, but that does not preclude or said to preclude this
Court from going into the factum of the petition for gross injustice
caused by an Order of the Supreme Court itself under the inherent
power being an authority to correct its errors any other view
should not and ought not be allowed to be continued. Needless to
record here, however, that review jurisdiction stand foisted upon
this Court in terms of the provisions of the Constitution, as noticed
hereinbefore and it is also well-settled that a second review petition
cannot be said to maintainable. Reference maybe made in thishttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 26 of 27
context to a decision of this Court in the case of J.Ranga Swamy v.
Govt. of A.P. & Ors. (AIR 1990 SC 535), wherein this Court in
paragraph 3 stated as below :-
"We are clearly of the opinion that these
applications are not maintainable. The petitioner,
who appeared in person, referred to the judgment
in Antulay’s case (1988) 2 SCC 602 : (AIR 1988
SC 1531). We are, however, of the opinion that
the principle of that case is not applicable here.
All the points which the petitioner urged
regarding the constitutionality of the Government
orders in question as well as the appointment of
respondent instead of petitioner to the post in
question had been urged before the Bench, which
heard the civil appeal and writ petitions originally.
The petitioner himself stated that he was heard by
the Bench at some length. It is, therefore, clear
that the matters were disposed of after a
consideration of all the points urged by the
petitioner and the mere fact that the order does not
discuss the contentions or give reasons cannot
entitle the petitioner to have what is virtually a
second review."
True, due regard shall have to have as regards opinion of the
Court in Ranga Swamy (supra), but the situation presently centres
round that in the event of there being any manifest injustice would
the doctrine of ex debito justitiae be said to be having a role to play
in sheer passivity or to rise above the ordinary heights as it
preaches that justice is above all. The second alternative seems to
be in consonance with time and present phase of socio-economic
conditions of the society. Manifest justice is curable in nature
rather than incurable and this court would lose its sanctity and thus
would belie the expectations of the founding fathers that justice is
above all. There is no manner of doubt that procedural
law/procedural justice cannot overreach the concept of justice and
in the event an Order stands out to create manifest injustice, would
the same be allowed to remain in silenco so as to affect the parties
perpetually or the concept of justice ought to activate the Court to
find a way out to resolve the erroneous approach to the problem.
Mr.Attorney General, with all the emphasis in his command,
though principally agreed that justice of the situation needs to be
looked into and relief be granted if so required but on the same
breath submitted that the Court ought to be careful enough to trade
on the path, otherwise the same will open up Pandora’s box and
thus, if at all, in rarest of the rare cases the further scrutiny may be
made. While it is true that law courts has overburdened itself with
the litigation and delay in disposal of matters in the subcontinent is
not unknown and in the event of any further appraisal of the matter
by this Court, it would brook on further delay resulting in
consequences which are not far to see but that would by itself not
in my view deter this Court from further appraisal of the matter in
the event the same, however, deserve such an additional appraisal
The note of caution sounded by Mr. Attorney as regards opening
up of pandora’s box strictly speaking, however, though may be of
very practical in nature but the same apparently does not seem to
go well with the concept of justice as adumbrated in our
constitution. True it is, that practicability of the situation needs a
serious consideration more so when this Court could do without it
for more than 50 years, which by no stretch of imagination can be
said to be a period not so short. I feel it necessary, however, to add
that it is not that we are not concerned with the consequences of
reopening of the issue but the redeeming feature of our justice
delivery system, as is prevalent in the country, is adherence tohttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 27 of 27
proper and effective administration of justice in stricto. In the
event there is any affectation of such an administration of justice
either by way of infraction of natural justice or an order being
passed wholly without jurisdiction or affectation of public
confidence as regards the doctrine of integrity in the justice
delivery system technicality ought not to out-weigh the course of
justice the same being the true effect of the doctrine of ex debito
justitiae. The oft quoted statement of law of Lord Hewart, CJ in R
v. Susssex Justices, ex p McCarthy (1924 (1) KB 256) that it is of
fundamental importance that justice should not only be done,
should manifestly and undoubtedly be seem to be done had this
doctrine underlined and administered therein. In this context, the
decision of the House of Lords in R v. Bow Street Metropolitan
Stipendiary Magistrate and others, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No.2)
seem to be an ipoc making decision, wherein public confidence on
the judiciary is said to be the basic criteria of the justice delivery
system any act or action even if it a passive one, if erodes or even
likely to erode the ethics of judiciary, matter needs a further look.
Brother Quadri has taken very great pains to formulate the
steps to be taken and the methodology therefor, in the event of
there being an infraction of the concept of justice, as such further
dilation would be an unnecessary exercise which I wish to avoid
since I have already recorded my concurrence therewith excepting,
however, lastly that curative petitions ought to be treated as a rarity
rather than regular and the appreciation of the Court shall have to
be upon proper circumspection having regard to the three basic
features of our justice delivery system to wit, the order being in
contravention of the doctrine of natural justice or without
jurisdiction or in the event of there is even a likelihood of public
confidence being shaken by reason of the association or closeness
of a judge with the subject matter in dispute. In my view, it is
now time that procedural justice system should give way to the
conceptual justice system and efforts of the law Court ought to be
so directed. Gone are the days where implementation of
draconian system of law or interpretation thereof were insisted
upon - Flexibility of the law Courts presently are its greatest virtue
and as such justice oriented approach is the need of the day to
strive and forge ahead in the 21st century. No costs.
