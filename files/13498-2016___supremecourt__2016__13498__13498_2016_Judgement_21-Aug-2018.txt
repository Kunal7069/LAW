Leave granted.
1. Respondent No.2 submitted a complaint to the
Chandanagar Police Station, Cyberabad, District Hyderabad
on 20.12.2015 alleging harassment by her husband and his
family members including the Appellants who are the
maternal uncles of her husband. She also complained of
the kidnapping of her son by the husband. On the basis of
the said complaint, an FIR was registered under Sections
498 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred
to as ‘the IPC’) at Chandanagar Police Station, Cyberabad,
1District Hyderabad on the same day. The Appellants filed
a petition under Section 482 Cr. P.C. for quashing the
proceedings in the crime registered pursuant to the
complaint of Respondent No.2. The High Court dismissed
the said petition by its judgment dated 22.01.2016. The
Station House Officer, Chandanagar Police Station,
Cyberabad was directed not to arrest the Appellants till the
completion of the investigation. Aggrieved by the
judgment of the High Court by which the petition under
Section 482 Cr. P.C. filed by the Appellants was dismissed,
they have filed the present appeal.
2. A charge sheet was filed on 12.03.2017 under
Sections 498A, 120 B, 420, 365 IPC after completion of the
investigation in Crime No.477 of 2015, Chandanagar Police
Station, Cyberabad. The Appellants are shown as A-4 to A-
6. As per the charge sheet, Respondent Nos.2 and 3
married on 08.12.2008 and were mostly residing in the
United States of America. There was a marital discord
between them. The allegations against the Appellants are
that they were supporting the third Respondent/husband
who was physically and mentally torturing the second
Respondent. The Appellants also conspired with the third
2Respondent who kidnapped the child from the custody of
the second Respondent and took him away to the U.S.A.
3. During the course of hearing, we enquired with the
learned Counsel for the State of Telengana whether a
supplementary charge sheet was being filed against the
Appellants. He produced a copy of the supplementary
charge sheet dated 20.12.2017.
4. A perusal of the charge sheet and the supplementary
charge sheet discloses the fact that the Appellants are not
the immediate family members of the third
Respondent/husband. They are the maternal uncles of the
third Respondent. Except the bald statement that they
supported the third Respondent who was harassing the
second Respondent for dowry and that they conspired with
the third Respondent for taking away his child to the U.S.A.,
nothing else indicating their involvement in the crime was
mentioned. The Appellants approached the High Court
when the investigation was pending. The charge sheet and
the supplementary charge sheet were filed after disposal of
the case by the High Court.
5. Criminal proceedings are not normally interdicted by
us at the interlocutory stage unless there is an abuse of
process of a Court. This Court, at the same time, does not
3hesitate to interfere to secure the ends of justice. See
State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal 1992 Supp. (1) SCC
335. The Courts should be careful in proceeding against
the distant relatives in crimes pertaining to matrimonial
disputes and dowry deaths. The relatives of the husband
should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations
unless specific instances of their involvement in the crime
are made out. See Kans Raj v. State of Punjab & Ors.
(2000) 5 SCC 207 and Kailash Chandra Agrawal and
Anr. v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors. (2014) 16 SCC
551.
6. The counsel for the second Respondent submitted that
certain documents belonging to the second Respondent
were seized from the Appellants which would show their
active involvement in the kidnapping of her child. On an
overall consideration of the contents of the charge sheet,
supplementary charge sheet and the submissions made on
behalf of the Respondent No.2, we are of the opinion that a
prima facie case has not been made out against the
Appellants for proceeding against them under Sections 498
A, 120 B, 420 and 365 IPC.
7. For the aforementioned reasons, we quash the
proceedings qua the Appellants in Crime No.477 of 2015,
4dated 20.12.2015 under Sections 498 A, 120 B, 420, 365
IPC registered at Chandanagar Police Station, Cyberabad
before the Court of IX, Metropolitan Magistrate, Kukatpally
at Miyapur, Cyberabad, Commissionerate.
8. The appeal is accordingly allowed.
