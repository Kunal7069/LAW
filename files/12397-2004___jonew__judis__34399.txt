about the manner in which the deceased was set on fire. In fact that the two dying
declarations can be reconciled with each other and since no other evidence was
available to connect accused with crime the conviction as recorded was held to be not
sustainable. Accordingly acquittal was directed.
3. Learned counsel for the appellant â€“ State submitted that the variation
between the two dying declarations was not very significant and the High Court
should not have discarded the subsequent dying declaration on the ground that it
was at variance with the first dying declaration.
4. There is no appearance on behalf of the respondent in spite of service of
notice.
5. There is no explanation as to why the second dying declaration was
recorded by the Head Constable of Police shortly after such a statement was
recorded when the dying declaration have already been recorded by the Magistrate.
It is not a case where the variation between the two dying declarations is of trivial in
nature. The scenario was described in substantially different manner. The High
Court noted that the improvements were made to rationalise with the injuries
sustained by the deceased. Conclusions of the High Court do not have any infirmity
which warrant any interference.
6. The appeals stands dismissed.
