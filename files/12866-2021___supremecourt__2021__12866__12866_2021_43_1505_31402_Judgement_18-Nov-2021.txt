IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.1240 OF 2021
(ARISING OUT OF SLP(CRL.) NO.6223 OF 2021)
RISHIPAL SINGH SOLANKI ……..APPELLANT(S)
VS.
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH & ORS. …...RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
NAGARATHNA J.
The appellant has preferred this appeal
against the impugned order dated 12.03.2021
passed by the High Court of Judicature at
Allahabad in Criminal Revision No.430 of 2021
whereby the High Court rejected the aforesaid
criminal revision filed against the judgment and
order dated 04.01.2021 passed by the Additional
District and Sessions Judge, Special Judge POCSO
Act (Exclusive Court), Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh,
dismissing the Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2020. The
said criminal appeal was filed against the order
dated 11.11.2020 passed by the Principal2
Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Baghpat
allowing the Miscellaneous Case No.16 of 2020
arising out of Case Crime No.116 of 2020 under
sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307, 302 and 34 of
the Indian Penal Code (for short, the ‘IPC’),
Police Station at Singhawali Ahir, District
Baghpat, Uttar Pradesh, and declaring the accused
– Nishant Solanki @ Nishu (respondent no.2
herein) as a juvenile delinquent.
2. Succinctly stated, the facts are that, in an
incident that occurred on 05.05.2020 at around
4:00 pm, inter alia, respondent no.2 – Nishant
Solanki @ Nishu (hereinafter referred to as
‘Nishant’) along with other accused are alleged
to have attacked upon the appellant and his
family causing serious injuries as well as death
of appellant’s father Bhopal Singh, who was
declared ‘brought dead’ by the doctor on the same
day i.e. 05.05.2020 and his uncle Kaluram, who
died on 09.05.2020 due to grievous injuries
sustained by him in the aforesaid incident.
3. Nishant, through his mother/natural
guardian-respondent no.3 herein, filed an3
application being Miscellaneous Case No.16/2020
before the Juvenile Justice Board (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘JJ Board’), Baghpat, praying
therein that the respondent no.2/accused viz.,
Nishant, be declared as a juvenile delinquent.
Evidence was let in on the said application
through respondent no.3 who is the mother and
natural guardian of Nishant. On coming to know
about the same, the appellant herein entered
appearance in the said proceeding through his
counsel and filed an application dated 20.07.2020
under Section 311 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure (for short, the ‘Cr.P.C.’) seeking
permission of the JJ Board to cross-examine
respondent no.3. The appellant herein was
permitted to do so on 22.07.2020, on which date
the application was posted for further cross-
examination of the mother of Nishant. On the said
date, respondent no.3 was further cross-examined
by the appellant.
4. Another witness, Manoj Kumar, Principal,
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Higher Secondary School,
Shajarpur, Kaidna, District Baghpat, was also4
examined as DW-2 on 10.08.2020 and subsequently,
Surendra Kumar Saini, Principal, Sarvoday Public
School, Khindora, District Baghpat, was examined
as DW-3.
5. The police also filed a charge-sheet under
Sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307, 302 and 34 of
the IPC against all the accused including
respondent no.2 – Nishant on 22.07.2020.
6. In the said proceedings, an application was
filed on 09.09.2020 before the JJ Board for
medical test of respondent no.2 Nishant to
ascertain his actual and true age. By order dated
14.09.2020, the said application was dismissed
and the matter was ordered to be posted on
23.09.2020 for hearing on the issue of
determination of age of the respondent no.2 –
Nishant.
7. Being aggrieved by the rejection of the
application dated 09.09.2020 seeking medical test
of respondent no.2 - Nishant, the appellant
herein filed a criminal revision before the5
District and Sessions Judge, Baghpat and an
application being Transfer Application (Criminal)
No.158/2020 before the High Court praying, inter
alia, for the transfer of proceedings in
Miscellaneous Case No.16/2020 pending before the
JJ Board, Baghpat, to some other JJ Board of the
State.
8. During the pendency of the aforesaid
proceedings before the High Court, the JJ Board,
Baghpat vide order dated 11.11.2020 allowed the
application being Misc. Case No.16/2020 filed by
respondent no.3 mother of Nishant and declared
Nishant as a juvenile delinquent. Assailing the
said order, the appellant filed an appeal being
Criminal Appeal No.27 of 2020 under section 101
of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of
Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as
the ‘JJ Act, 2015’) before the District and
Sessions Judge, Baghpat. The said Court dismissed
the said appeal by its judgment dated 04.01.2021
against which the appellant filed a Criminal
Revision No.430 of 2021 before the High Court.
The said criminal revision was also rejected by6
the High Court vide impugned order dated
12.03.2021. Being aggrieved of the same, the
appellant has filed the present appeal by special
leave before this Court.
9. We have heard Mr. Anupam Dwivedi, learned
counsel for the appellant, Mr. Sharan Thakur,
learned Additional Advocate General for the
respondent – State of Uttar Pradesh, and
Mr. Saurabh Trivedi, learned counsel for
respondent nos.2 and 3 and perused the record.
10. Mr. Dwivedi, learned counsel for the
appellant contended that respondent no.2 has been
accused of committing grave offences under
sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307, 302 and 34 of
the IPC along with other co-accused, but
respondent no.2 has filed an application claiming
juvenility and the same has been allowed
erroneously by the JJ Board at Baghpat which
order has been sustained by the appellate court
as well as the High Court. It was contended that
there are contradictions in the evidence of the
witnesses examined on behalf of the accused-7
respondent no.2, particularly, his mother with
regard to his date of birth which is stated to be
25.09.2004 but the same has not been established
in accordance with law. The School Admission Form
(Annexure P-11) was produced as Ex.A-8 to show
that the same was signed by respondent no.2
Nishant when he was purportedly four years of
age. Ex.A-9 (Annexure P-12) is stated to be a
document signed by respondent no.2 Nishant when
he was twelve years of age. He submitted that the
signatures on both these documents are identical.
Hence, the genuineness of the said documents is
in grave doubt and the same could not have been
relied upon in support of the claim of juvenility
made by respondent no.2 herein.
11. In Ex.A-8, our attention was drawn to Column
No.15 requiring the Aadhaar number of the student
to be filled, to contend that the said form is
said to have been submitted on 02.07.2009 seeking
admission of respondent no.2. That in July 2001
the requirement of furnishing UID/Aadhaar number
could not arise at all as it was issued for the
first time to a resident of Nandurbar,8
Maharashtra only on 29.09.2010. It was urged that
Ex.A-8 (Annexure P-11) is a got up document in
order to misrepresent the age of respondent no.2
and thereby claim the benefit of juvenility. It
was further contended that if in the year 2009,
respondent no.2 sought admission to the Class 1
when he was less than five years of age, then,
after a period of five years only, he could not
have sought admission to Class 8. There is no
explanation as to how he could have sought
admission to Class 8 only after five years of
seeking admission to Class 1. It was also
submitted that DW-3, Principal of the primary
school during his cross-examination admitted that
the signature of Nishant on the admission forms
of class 1 and class 8 are identical. Hence it
was contended that it is doubtful as to how an
infant, who was aged about four years, (if really
the date of birth of respondent no.2 was
25.09.2004,) could have signed his name on the
school admission form when he sought admission to
class 1. It was contended that such a signature
is forged as no child who is four years of age
would have been able to sign his name on the9
school admission form and secondly, could not
have also sought admission to class 1 at that
age.
12. It was contended that the JJ Board has not
appreciated the legislative intent behind section
94 of the JJ Act, 2015 by declaring that
matriculation certificate is a conclusive
document for determining the age of the juvenile
irrespective of other material discrepancies in
the oral testimony of the witnesses or other
documents being produced. In support of the said
submissions, reliance was placed on Parag Bhati
vs. State of Uttar Pradesh – (2016) 12 SCC 744;
Sanjeev Kumar Gupta vs. State of Uttar Pradesh &
Anr. – (2019) 12 SCC 370; and Abuzar Hossain vs.
State of West Bengal – (2012) 10 SCC 489.
13. It was further contended that in the
aforesaid cases, the claim of juvenility of the
accused was rejected due to discrepancies in the
evidence, notwithstanding the fact that as per
the matriculation certificate issued to the
accused therein, they were juveniles. In other10
words, it was contended that the age shown in the
matriculation certificate cannot be accepted on
its face value if there is other evidence which
contradicts the same. It was hence contended that
the impugned order of the High Court, judgment of
the appellate court and order passed by the JJ
Board, Baghpat, may be set aside and the
application filed on behalf of the respondent
no.2-Nishant may be dismissed.
14. Mr. Sharan Thakur, learned additional
Advocate General for the State of Uttar Pradesh,
supported the contentions of learned counsel for
the appellant and submitted that the
matriculation certificate relied upon by
respondent no.2 cannot be accepted as the
accompanying document, though the age of Nishant
indicated in the matriculation certificate
coincides with the age indicated in Ex-A8 and A9.
It was contended that these documents cannot be
accepted on their face value as the said exhibits
could not have borne the signature of Nishant.
They are also not in consonance with the age at
which Nishant would have been admitted to school11
and completed his matriculation. Therefore, it
was contended that the orders impugned namely,
the order of the High Court as well as the orders
of the learned District Judge and the JJ Board
may be set aside.
15. Mr. Saurabh Trivedi, learned counsel for
respondent nos.2 and 3, contended that Nishant
was born on 25.09.2004 and on the date of the
incident i.e.05.05.2020, he was a minor being
only 15 years and 8 months of age. That
initially, he studied in a private school in the
village and was admitted to class 1 in 2009; he
passed classes 6, 7, and 8 from Sarvoday Public
Junior High School, Village Khindoda, District
Baghpat and got a school transfer certificate on
31.03.2017 wherein his date of birth was shown as
25.09.2004; that Nishant joined Sardar Vallabh
Bhai Patel Higher Secondary School, Khanjarpur
Khaidar, District Baghpat, on 04.07.2017 and
completed his High School and cleared the Board
examination with 85% marks. The U.P. State Board
of Secondary Education issued a High School
Certificate on completion of Board Examination12
for Class 10 showing his date of birth as
25.09.2004. Therefore, on the date of the
incident i.e.05.05.2020, respondent no.2 was a
juvenile and hence the JJ Board as well the High
Court have rightly appreciated the case of
respondent no.2-Nishant and allowed his
application claiming juvenility. It was contended
that the matriculation certificate or the
certificate issued by the Board conducting the
said examination (Annexure P-15) is sufficient
proof of the age of the juvenile as per the
requirements of JJ Act, 2015. Reliance was placed
on Ashwani Kumar Saxena vs. State of M.P. –
(2012) 9 SCC 750, to contend that the
matriculation certificate is a document on which
full reliance could be placed for determination
of the age of the juvenile accused. Hence, there
is no merit in this appeal.
16. It was further submitted that the appellant
cannot seek ossification test of respondent no.2
for the purpose of determination of his age as
the same is not conclusive for the purpose of
determination of the age vide Babloo Pasi vs.13
State of Jharkhand – (2008) 13 SCC 133 and State
of M.P. vs. Anoop Singh – (2015) 7 SCC 773.
17. It was urged that the appellant has not been
successful in negating the case of respondent
no.2 Nishant, who, being a juvenile on the date
of the incident is entitled to all protection
under the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015. It was
submitted that there is no merit in the appeal
and the same may be dismissed.
18. The JJ Act, 2015 is a sequel to the Juvenile
Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act,
2000 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘JJ Act,
2000’) which has since been repealed. Under the
JJ Act, 2000, an amendment was made by Act 33 of
2006 with effect from 22.8.2006 under which
section 7A of was inserted which reads as under:
“7A. Procedure to be followed when claim
of juvenility is raised before any court.—
(1) Whenever a claim of juvenility is
raised before any court or a court is of
the opinion that an accused person was a
juvenile on the date of commission of the
offence, the court shall make an inquiry,
take such evidence as may be necessary
(but not an affidavit) so as to determine
the age of such person, and shall record a
finding whether the person is a juvenile14
or a child or not, stating his age as
nearly as may be:
Provided that a claim of juvenility may be
raised before any court and it shall be
recognised at any stage, even after final
disposal of the case, and such claim shall
be determined in terms of the provisions
contained in this Act and the rules made
thereunder, even if the juvenile has
ceased to be so on or before the date of
commencement of this Act.
(2) If the court finds a person to be a
juvenile on the date of commission of the
offence under sub-section (1), it shall
forward the juvenile to the Board for
passing appropriate orders and the
sentence, if any, passed by a court shall
be deemed to have no effect.”
Section 49 of the said Act reads as under:
“49. Presumption and determination of
age.-(1) Where it appears to a competent
authority that person brought before it
under any of the provisions of this Act
(otherwise than for the purpose of giving
evidence) is a juvenile or the child, the
competent authority shall make due
inquiry so as to the age of that person
and for that purpose shall take such
evidence as may be necessary (but not an
affidavit) and shall record a finding
whether the person is a juvenile or the
child or not, stating his age as nearly
as may be.
(2) No order of a competent authority
shall be deemed to have become invalid
merely by any subsequent proof that the
person in respect of whom the order has
been made is not a juvenile or the child,
and the age recorded by the competent
authority to be the age of person so
brought before it, shall for the purpose
of this Act, be deemed to be the true age
of that person.”15
19. Rule 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and
Protection of Children) Rules, 2007 (hereinafter
referred to as the ‘JJ Rules, 2007’) prescribed
the procedures for determination of age. Rule 12
reads as under –
“12. Procedure to be followed in
determination of Age.
(1) In every case concerning a child or a
juvenile in conflict with law, the court
or the Board or as the case may be the
Committee referred to in Rule 19 of these
rules shall determine the age of such
juvenile or child or a juvenile in
conflict with law within a period of
thirty days from the date of making of the
application for that purpose.
(2) The Court or the Board or as the case
may be the Committee shall decide the
juvenility or otherwise of the juvenile or
the child or as the case may be the
juvenile in conflict with law, prima facie
on the basis of physical appearance or
documents, if available, and send him to
the observation home or in jail.
(3) In every case concerning a child or
juvenile in conflict with law, the age
determination inquiry shall be conducted
by the court or the Board or, as the case
may be, the Committee by seeking evidence
by obtaining -
(a) (i) the matriculation or
equivalent certificates, if available;
and in the absence whereof;
(ii) the date of birth certificate
from the school (other than a play
school) first attended; and in the
absence whereof;16
(iii) the birth certificate given by a
corporation or a municipal authority
or a panchayat;
(b) and only in the absence of either
(i), (ii) or (iii) of clause (a)
above, the medical opinion will be
sought from a duly constituted Medical
Board, which will declare the age of
the juvenile or child. In case exact
assessment of the age cannot be done,
the Court or the Board or, as the case
may be, the Committee, for the reasons
to be recorded by them, may, if
considered necessary, give benefit to
the child or juvenile by considering
his/her age on lower side within the
margin of one year.
and, while passing orders in such case
shall, after taking into consideration
such evidence as may be available, or the
medical opinion, as the case may be,
record a finding in respect of his age and
either of the evidence specified in any of
the clauses (a)(i), (ii), (iii) or in the
absence whereof, clause (b) shall be the
conclusive proof of the age as regards
such child or Ihe juvenile in conflict
with law.
(4) If the age of a juvenile or child or the
juvenile in conflict with law is found to be
below 18 years on the date of offence, on the
basis of any of the conclusive proof specified
in sub-rule (3), the Court or the Board or as
the case may be the Committee shall in writing
pass an order stating the age and declaring the
status of juvenility or otherwise, for the
purpose of the Act and these rules and a copy
of the order shall be given to such juvenile or
the person concerned.
(5) Save and except where, further inquiry or
otherwise is required, inter alia, in terms of
section 7A, section 64 of the Act and these
rules, no further inquiry shall be conducted by
the court or the Board after examining and
obtaining the certificate or any other17
documentary proof referred to in sub-rule (3)
of this rule.
(6) The provisions contained in this rule shall
also apply to those disposed of cases, where
the status of juvenility has not been
determined in accordance with the provisions
contained in sub-rule (3) and the Act,
requiring dispensation of the sentence under
the Act for passing appropriate order in the
interest of the juvenile in conflict with law.”
20. Rule 12 of the JJ Rules, 2007 deals with the
procedure to be followed in determination of age.
The juvenility of a person in conflict with law
had to be decided prima facie on the basis of
physical appearance, or documents, if available.
But an inquiry into the determination of age by
the Court or the JJ Board was by seeking evidence
by obtaining : (i) the matriculation or
equivalent certificates, if available and in the
absence whereof; (ii) the date of birth
certificate from the school (other than a play
school) first attended; and in the absence
whereof; (iii) the birth certificate given by a
corporation or a municipal authority or a
panchayat. Only in the absence of either (i),
(ii) and (iii) above, the medical opinion could
be sought from a duly constituted Medical Board18
to declare the age of the juvenile or child. It
was also provided that while determination was
being made, benefit could be given to the child
or juvenile by considering the age on lower side
within the margin of one year. If a juvenile in
conflict with law was found to be below 18 years,
an order had to be passed declaring the status of
the juvenility by the Court. The said procedure
was also applicable to dispose off cases where
the status of the juvenility had not been
determined in accordance with the Act and the
Rules made thereunder.
21. On repeal of JJ Act, 2000 and on the
enforcement of JJ Act, 2015, the procedure to be
followed when a claim of juvenility is raised
before any court, other than a Board is
stipulated under section 9(2)&(3). The same reads
as under –
“2) In case a person alleged to have
committed an offence claims before a court
other than a Board, that the person is a
child or was a child on the date of
commission of the offence, or if the court
itself is of the opinion that the person was
a child on the date of commission of the
offence, the said court shall make an
inquiry, take such evidence as may be
necessary (but not an affidavit) to determine19
the age of such person, and shall record a
finding on the matter, stating the age of the
person as nearly as may be:
Provided that such a claim may be raised
before any court and it shall be recognised
at any stage, even after final disposal of
the case, and such a claim shall be
determined in accordance with the provisions
contained in this Act and the rules made
thereunder even if the person has ceased to
be a child on or before the date of
commencement of this Act.
(3) If the court finds that a person has
committed an offence and was a child on the
date of commission of such offence, it shall
forward the child to the Board for passing
appropriate orders and the sentence, if any,
passed by the court shall be deemed to have
no effect.”
There is no corresponding Rule to determine
juvenility akin to Rule 12 of the JJ Rules, 2007.
22. On the other hand, under section 94 of the JJ
Act, 2015, a presumption is raised that when a
person is brought before the JJ Board or the
Child Welfare Committee (‘Committee’ for short)
(other than for the purpose of giving evidence)
and the said person is a child, the JJ Board or
the Committee shall record such observation
stating the age of the child as nearly as may be,
and proceed with the inquiry under section 14 or20
section 36, as the case may be, without waiting
for further confirmation of the age. But where
the said Board or the Committee has reasonable
grounds for doubt regarding whether the person
brought before it is a child or not, the JJ Board
or the Committee, as the case may be, shall
undertake the process of age determination by
seeking evidence by obtaining -
(i) the date of birth certificate from the
school, or the matriculation or equivalent
certificate from the concerned examination
Board, if available; and in the absence
thereof;
(ii) the birth certificate given by a
corporation or a municipal authority or a
panchayat;
(iii) and only in the absence of (i) and (ii)
above, age shall be determined by an
ossification test or any other latest
medical age determination test conducted
on the orders of the Committee or the
Board.
Provided such age determination test
conducted on the order of the Committee or the
Board shall be completed within fifteen days from
the date of such order. The age recorded by the21
Committee or the Board to be the age of person so
brought before it shall, for the purpose of the
Act, be deemed to be the true age of that person.
For immediate reference section 94 of JJ Act,
2015 is extracted as under:
“94. Presumption and determination of age.-
(1) Where, it is obvious to the Committee
or the Board, based on the appearance of
the person brought before it under any of
the provisions of this Act (other than for
the purpose of giving evidence) that the
said person is a child, the Committee or
the Board shall record such observation
stating the age of the child as nearly as
may be and proceed with the inquiry under
section 14 or section 36, as the case may
be, without waiting for further
confirmation of the age.
(2) In case, the Committee or the Board has
reasonable grounds for doubt regarding
whether the person brought before it is a
child or not, the Committee or the Board,
as the case may be, shall undertake the
process of age determination, by seeking
evidence by obtaining –
a) the date of birth certificate from the
school, or the matriculation or equivalent
certificate from the concerned examination
Board, if available; and in the absence
thereof;
b) the birth certificate given by a
corporation or a municipal authority or a
panchayat;
c) and only in the absence of (i) and
(ii) above, age shall be determined by an
ossification test or any other latest
medical age determination test conducted on
the orders of the Committee or the Board.
Provided such age determination test
conducted on the order of the Committee or22
the Board shall be completed within fifteen
days from the date of such order.
(3) The age recorded by the Committee or
the Board to be the age of person so
brought before it shall, for the purpose of
this Act, be deemed to be the true age of
that person.
23. Under section 7A of JJ Act, 2000 which was
inserted by an amendment with effect from
22.08.2006, provision was made to claim
juvenility by contending that the accused person
was a juvenile on the date of commission of the
offence and in such a case, on the evidence taken
on record, a finding regarding the age of such
person had to be recorded by the court, other
than a JJ Board. The claim for juvenility could
be raised before any Court and at any stage, even
after the final disposal of a case and such claim
had to be determined in terms of the said Act and
the rules made thereunder. If the Court found a
person to be a juvenile on the date of commission
of offence under sub-section (1) of section 7A of
the JJ Act, 2000, it had to forward the juvenile
to the JJ Board for passing appropriate orders
and the sentence, if any, passed by a Court would
not have any effect. However, under the JJ Act,23
2015, a provision corresponding to section 7A of
the JJ Act, 2000, is in the form of sub-section 2
of section 9 of the said Act, which has been
extracted above.
24. Further, unlike section 49 of JJ Act, 2000,
section 94 of JJ Act, 2015 provides for
presumption and determination of age if the
Juvenile Justice Board or the Committee has
reasonable grounds to doubt whether the person
brought before it is a child or not. It shall
undertake the process of determination of age by
seeking evidence such as:
(i) the date of birth certificate from the
school, or the matriculation or equivalent
certificate from the concerned examination Board,
if available; and in the absence thereof;
(ii) the birth certificate given by a corporation
or a municipal authority or a panchayat; and
(iii) only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above,
age shall be determined by an ossification test
or any other latest medical age determination24
test conducted on the orders of the Committee or
the Board.
25. The difference in the procedure under the
two enactments could be discerned as under:
(i) As per JJ Act, 2015 in the absence of
requisite documents as mentioned in Sub-section
(2) of Section 94(a) and (b), there is provision
for determination of the age by an ossification
test or any other medical age related test to be
conducted on the orders of the Committee or the
JJ Board as per Section 94 of the said Act;
whereas, under Rule 12 of the JJ Rules, 2007, in
the absence of relevant documents, a medical
opinion had to be sought from a duly constituted
Medical Board which would declare the age of the
juvenile or child.
(ii) With regard to the documents to be provided
as evidence, what was provided under Rule 12 of
the JJ Rules, 2007 has been provided under sub-
section 2 of section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 as a
substantive provision.25
(iii) Under Section 49 of the JJ Act, 2000,
where it appeared to a competent authority that a
person brought before it was a juvenile or a
child, then such authority could, after making an
inquiry and taking such evidence as was
necessary, record a finding as to the juvenility
of such person and state the age of such person
as nearly as may be. Sub-section (2) of Section
49 stated that no order of a competent authority
shall be deemed to have become invalid merely by
any subsequent proof that the person in respect
of whom the order had been made is not a juvenile
and the age recorded by the competent authority
to be the age of person so brought before it, for
the purpose of the Act, be deemed to be the true
age of that person.
26. But, under Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015,
which also deals with presumption and
determination of age, the Committee or the JJ
Board has to record such observation stating the
age of the child as nearly as may be and proceed
with the inquiry without waiting for further26
confirmation of the age. It is only when the
Committee or the JJ Board has reasonable grounds
for doubt regarding whether the person brought
before it is a child or not, it can undertake the
process of age determination, by seeking
evidence.
27. Sub-section (3) of Section 94 states that
the age recorded by the Committee or the JJ Board
to be the age of the persons so brought before it
shall, for the purpose of the Act, be deemed to
be the true age of that person. Thus, there is a
finality attached to the determination of the age
recorded and it is only in a case where
reasonable grounds exist for doubt as to whether
the person brought before the Committee or the
Board is a child or not, that a process of age
determination by seeking evidence has to be
undertaken.
28. The relevant decisions on the provisions
under consideration could be referred to at this
stage:27
(a) In the case of Ashwani Kumar Saxena v. State
of Madhya Pradesh - (2012) 9 SCC 750, this
Court opined that under Section 7A of JJ
Act, 2000 obligated the Court to make an
inquiry and not an investigation or trial
under the Code of Criminal Procedure. The
Court stated its opinion in the following
words :
“34……..There may be situations where the
entry made in the matriculation or
equivalent certificates, date of birth
certificate from the school first
attended and even the birth certificate
given by a corporation or a municipal
authority or a panchayat may not be
correct. But court, Juvenile Justice
Board or a committee functioning under
the JJ Act is not expected to conduct
such a roving enquiry and to go behind
those certificates to examine the
correctness of those documents, kept
during the normal course of business.
Only in cases where those documents or
certificates are found to be fabricated
or manipulated, the court, the Juvenile
Justice Board or the committee need to
go for medical report for age
determination.”
(b) Reference could also be made to another
decision of this Court in the case of Abuzar
Hossain alias Gulam Hossain v. State of West
Bengal - (2012) 10 SCC 489, wherein it has
been summarized as under:28
"39.1. A claim of juvenility may be
raised at any stage even after the
final disposal of the case. It may be
raised for the first time before this
Court as well after the final disposal
of the case. The delay in raising the
claim of juvenility cannot be a ground
for rejection of such claim. The claim
of juvenility can be raised in appeal
even if not pressed before the trial
Court and can be raised for the first
time before this Court though not
pressed before the trial Court and in
the appeal Court.
39.2. For making a claim with regard
to juvenility after conviction, the
claimant must produce some material
which may prima facie satisfy the
Court that an inquiry into the claim
of juvenility is necessary. Initial
burden has to be discharged by the
person who claims juvenility.
39.3. As to what materials would prima
facie satisfy the Court and/or ae
sufficient for discharging the initial
burden cannot be catalogued nor can it
be laid down as to what weight should
be given to a specific piece of
evidence which may be sufficient to
raise presumption of juvenility but
the documents referred to in Rules
12(3)(a) (i) to (iii) shall definitely
be sufficient for prima facie
satisfaction of the Court about the
age of the delinquent necessitating
further enquiry under Rule 12. The
statement recorded 22-10-2021 (Page 6
of 12) under Section 313 of the Code
is too tentative and may not by itself
be sufficient ordinarily to justify or
reject the claim of juvenility. The
credibility and/or acceptability of
the documents like the school leaving
certificate or the voters list, etc.
obtained after conviction would depend
on the facts and circumstances of each
case and no hard-and-fast rule can be
prescribed that they must he prima
facie accepted or rejected. In Akbar29
Sheikh - (2009) 7 SCC 415 and Pawan -
(2009) 15 SCC 259, these documents
were not found prima facie credible
while in Jitendra Singh - (2010) 13
SCC 523 the documents viz., school
leaving certificate, marksheet and the
medical report were treated sufficient
for directing an inquiry and
verification of the appellant’s age.
If such documents, prima facie,
inspire confidence of the Court, the
Court may act upon such documents for
the purposes of Section 7-A and order
an enquiry for determination of the
age of the delinquent.
39.4. An affidavit of the claimant or
any of the parents or a sibling or a
relative in support of the claim of
juvenility raised for the first time
in appeal or revision or before this
Court during the pendency of the
matter or after disposal of the case
shall not be sufficient justifying an
enquiry to determine the age of such
person unless the circumstances of the
case are so glaring that satisfy the
judicial conscience of the Court to
order an enquiry into determination of
the age of the delinquent.
39.5. The Court where the plea of
juvenility is raised for the first
time should always be guided by the
objectives of the 2000 Act and be
alive to the position that the
beneficent and salutary provisions
contained in the 2000 Act are not
defeated by the hyper technical
approach and the persons who are
entitled to get benefits of the 2000
Act shall get such benefits. The
Courts should not be unnecessarily
influenced by any general impression
that in schools the parents/guardians
understate the age of their wards by
one or two years for future benefits
or that age determination by medical
examination is not very precise. The
matter should be considered prima
facie on the touchstone of30
preponderance of probability. 39.6.
Claim of juvenility lacking in
credibility or frivolous claim of
juvenility or patently absurd or
inherently improbable claim of
juvenility must be rejected by the
Court at the threshold whenever
raised."
(c) In Arnit Das v. State of Bihar - (2000) 5
SCC 488, this Court observed that while
considering the question as to determination
of the age of an accused for the purpose of
ascertaining whether he is a juvenile or
not, a hyper-technical approach should not
be adopted while appreciating the evidence
adduced in support of the plea that he was a
juvenile and, if two views may be possible,
the Court should lean in favour of holding
the accused to be a juvenile in borderline
cases. This is because the Act being a
welfare legislation, Courts should be
zealous to see that a juvenile derives full
benefits of the provisions of the Act but at
the same time it is also imperative for the
Courts to ensure that the protection and
privileges under the Act are not misused by31
unscrupulous persons to escape punishment
for having committed serious offences.
(d) In Jitendra Ram v. State of Jharkhand -
(2006) 9 SCC 428, this Court has sounded a
note of caution on the earlier observations
made by it in the case of Bhola Bhagat &
others v. State of Bihar - (1997) 8 SCC
720, wherein it was observed that an
obligation has been cast on the Court that
where such a plea is raised having regard to
the beneficial nature of the socially
oriented legislation, the same should be
examined with great care. This Court
referring to its decision in Bhola Bhagat
(supra) observed as follows :
“20. …We are, however, of the opinion
that the same would not mean that a
person who is not entitled to the
benefit of the said Act would be dealt
with leniently only because such a plea
is raised. Each plea must be judged on
its own merit. Each case has to be
considered on the basis of the materials
brought on records.”
The aforesaid observations were made in the
context of what had been stated in Bhola
Bhagat vs. State of Bihar – (1997) 8 SCC 720
which is extracted as under:32
“18. Before parting with this judgment,
we would like to reemphasis that when a
plea is raised on behalf of an accused
that he was a “child” within the meaning
of the definition of the expression
under the Act, it becomes obligatory for
the court, in case it entertains any
doubt about the age as claimed by the
accused, to hold an inquiry itself for
determination of the question of age of
the accused or cause an enquiry to be
held and seek a report regarding the
same, if necessary, by asking the
parties to lead evidence in that regard.
Keeping in view the beneficial nature of
the socially oriented legislation, it is
an obligation of the court where such a
plea is raised to examine that plea with
care and it cannot fold its hands and
without returning a positive finding
regarding that plea, deny the benefit of
the provisions of an accused. The court
must hold an enquiry and return a
finding regarding the age, one way or
the other.”
(e) Further, in Jabar Singh v. Dinesh and
another - (2010) 3 SCC 757, this Court
considered a situation wherein the entry of
date of birth in the admission form of the
school records or transfer certificates did
not satisfy the condition laid down under
Section 35 of the Evidence Act, i.e., the
said entry was not in any public or official
register and was not made either by a public
servant, in the discharge of his official33
duty or by any person in performance of a
duty specially enjoined by the law of the
country and therefore the said evidence was
not relevant for the purpose of determining
the age of the accused in the said case. In
the aforesaid case, this Court set aside the
order of the High Court in revision and
confirmed the order of the trial Court
holding that the accused therein was a
juvenile at the time of the commission of
the alleged offence.
(f) In Babloo Pasi Vs. State of Jharkhand and
another - (2008) 13 SCC 133, this Court while
dealing with the provisions of JJ Act, 2000,
observed as under:
“22. it is well settled that it is
neither feasible nor desirable to lay
down an abstract formula to determine
the age of a person. The date of birth
is to be determined on the basis of
material on record and on appreciation
of evidence adduced by the parties. The
medical evidence as to the age of a
person, though a very useful guiding
factor, is not conclusive and has to be
considered along with other cogent
evidence.
23. It is true that in Arnit Das v.
State of Bihar this Court has, on a
review of judicial opinion, observed
that while dealing with a question of34
determination of the age of an accused,
for the purpose of finding out whether
he is a juvenile or not, a hyper-
technical approach should not be adopted
while appreciating the evidence adduced
on behalf of the accused in support of
the plea that he was a juvenile and if
two views may be possible on the same
evidence, the court should lean in
favour of holding the accused to be a
juvenile in borderline cases. We are
also not oblivious of the fact that
being a welfare legislation, the courts
should be zealous to see that a juvenile
derives full benefits of the provisions
of the Act but at the same time it is
also imperative for the courts to ensure
that the protection and privileges under
the Act are not misused by unscrupulous
persons to escape punishments for having
committed serious offences.”
(g) In State of Madhya Pradesh v. Anoop Singh -
(2015) 7 SCC 733, it was observed that the
ossification test is not the sole criterion
for determination of date of birth, when
birth certificate and middle school
certificate are available. It was observed
that the High court was not right in
presuming that the prosecutrix, therein, was
more than 18 years of age at the time of the
incident. There was a difference of two days
in the date of birth mentioned in the birth
certificate and the middle school certificate35
but the same was held to be a minor
discrepancy. In that case, it was held that
prosecutrix was below 16 years of age at the
date of the incident and set aside the
judgment passed by the High Court.
(h) Sanjeev Kumar Gupta vs. State of Uttar
Pradesh and another - (2019) 12 SCC 370, is a
judgment authored by one of us (Hon’ble Dr.
D.Y. Chandrachud, J.), wherein the
credibility and authenticity of the
matriculation certificate for the purpose of
determination of the age under Section-7A of
the JJ Act, 2000, came up for consideration.
In the said case, the JJ Board had rejected
the claim of juvenility and this Court
confirmed the decision of the JJ Board
rejecting the claim of juvenility by setting
aside the judgment of the High Court. In the
said case, it was observed that the records
maintained by the CBSE were purely on the
basis of the final list of the students
forwarded by the Senior Secondary School
where the second respondent therein had36
studied from class 5 to 10, and not on the
basis of any other underlying document. On
the other hand, there was clear and
unimpeachable evidence of date of birth which
had been recorded in the records of another
school which the second respondent therein
had attended till class 4 and which was
supported by voluntary disclosure made by the
accused therein while obtaining both, Aadhaar
Card and driving license. It was observed
that the date of birth reflected in the
matriculation certificate could not be
accepted as authentic or credible. In the
said case, it was held that the date of birth
of the second respondent therein was
17.12.1995 and that he was not entitled to
claim juvenility as the date of the alleged
incident was 18.08.2015.
In the said case, the judgment of this
Court in Ashwani Kumar Saxena (supra) and
Abuzar Hossain (supra) were considered and it
was noted that the decision in Abuzar
Hossain was rendered three days after the37
decision in Ashwani Kumar Saxena, and in
Abuzar Hossain, which was a three- Judge
Bench decision, it was observed that the
credibility and acceptability of the
documents, including the school leaving
certificate, would depend on the facts and
circumstances of each case and no hard and
fast rule as such could be laid down in that
regard.
It was observed in Abuzar Hossain
(supra) by Hon’ble T.S. Thakur J., as then
the learned Chief Justice was, that directing
an inquiry is not the same thing as declaring
the accused to be a juvenile. In the former,
the Court simply records a prima facie
conclusion, while a declaration is made on
the basis of evidence. Hence, the approach at
the stage of directing an inquiry has to be
more liberal lest, there is miscarriage of
justice. The standard of proof required is
different for both. In the former, the Court
simply records the prima facie conclusion. It
would eventually depend on how the Court38
evaluates such material for a prima facie
conclusion and the Court may or may not
direct an inquiry. In the latter, the Court
makes a declaration on evidence that it
scrutinises and accepts such evidence only if
it is worthy of acceptance. His Lordship
further observed as under:
“The Court would, therefore, in each
case weigh the relevant factors, insist
upon filing of better affidavits if the
need so arises, and even direct, any
additional information considered
relevant including the information
regarding the age of the parents, the
age of siblings and the like, to be
furnished before it decides on a case-
to-case basis whether or not an enquiry
under Section 7-A ought to be conducted.
It will eventually depend on how the
court evaluates such material for a
prima facie conclusion that the court
may or may not direct an enquiry.”
(i) In case of Parag Bhati (Juvenile through
Legal Guardian-Mother-Smt. Rajini Bhati v.
State of Uttar Pradesh and another – (2016)
12 SCC 744, both the aforesaid judgments were
considered and this Court observed as under:
"34.It is no doubt true that if there is a
clear and unambiguous case in favour of the
juvenile accused that he was a minor below
the age of 18 years on the date of the
incident and the documentary evidence at
least prima facie proves the same, he would
be entitled to the special protection under39
the JJ Act. But when an accused commits a
grave and heinous offence and thereafter
attempts to take statutory shelter under
the guise of being a minor, a casual or
cavalier approach while recording as to
whether an accused is a juvenile or not
cannot be permitted as the Courts are
enjoined upon to perform their duties with
the object of protecting the confidence of
common man in the institution entrusted
with the administration of justice.
35. The benefit of the principle of
benevolent legislation attached to the JJ
Act would thus apply to only such cases
wherein the accused is held to be a
juvenile on the basis of at least prima
facie evidence regarding his minority as
the benefit of the possibilities of two
views in regard to the age of the alleged
accused who is involved in grave and
serious offence which he committed and gave
effect to it in a well-planned manner
reflecting his maturity of mind rather than
innocence indicating that his plea of
juvenility is more in the nature of a
shield to dodge or dupe the arms of law
cannot be allowed to come to his rescue.
(Emphasis added) From the above decision,
it is clear that the purpose of Juvenile
Justice Act, 2000 is not to give shelter to
the accused of grave and heinous offences.
36. It is settled position of law that if
the matriculation or equivalent
certificates are available and there is no
other material to prove the correctness of
date of birth, the date of birth mentioned
in the matriculation certificate has to be
treated as a conclusive proof of the date
of birth of the accused. However, if there
is any doubt or a contradictory stand is
being taken by the accused which raises a
doubt on the correctness of the date of
birth then as laid down by this Court in
Abuzar Hossain, an enquiry for
determination of the age of the accused is
permissible which has been done in the
present case.”40
(j) In the judgment rendered by Hon’ble Hemant
Gupta, J., in Ram Vijay Singh vs. State of
Uttar Pradesh – 2021 CriLJ 2805, it was
observed that the ossification test is not the
sole criterion of age determination and a
blind and mechanical view regarding the age of
the person cannot be adopted solely on the
basis of medical opinion by radiological
examination. Though, radiological examination
is a useful guiding factor for determining the
age of a person, the evidence is not of a
conclusive and incontrovertible nature and it
is subject to a margin of error. Medical
evidence as to the age of a person, though a
very useful guiding factor, is not conclusive
and has to be considered along with other
circumstances. The relevant paragraphs of the
said judgment are extracted as under:
“14. We find that the procedure prescribed in
Rule 12 is not materially different than the
provisions of Section 94 of the Act to
determine the age of the person There are
minor variations as the Rule 12(3)(a)(i) and
(ii) have been clubbed together with slight
change in the language. Section 94 of the Act
does not contain the provisions regarding
benefit of margin of age to be given to the
child or juvenile as was provided in Rule41
12(30(b) of the Rules. The importance of
ossification test has not undergone change
with the enactment of Section 94 of the Act.
The reliability of the ossification test
remains vulnerable as was Under Rule 12 of the
Rules.
15. As per the Scheme of the Act, when it is
obvious to the Committee or the Board, based
on the appearance of the person, that the said
person is a child, the Board or Committee
shall record observations stating the age of
the Child as nearly as may be without waiting
for further confirmation of the age.
Therefore, the first attempt to determine the
age is by assessing the physical appearance of
the person when brought before the Board or
the Committee. It is only in case of doubt,
the process of age determination by seeking
evidence becomes necessary. At that stage,
when a person is around 18 years of age, the
ossification test can be said to be relevant
for determining the approximate age of a
person in conflict with law. However, when the
person is around 40-55 years of age, the
structure of bones cannot be helpful in
determining the age. This Court in Arjun
Panditrao Khotkar v. Kailash Kushanrao
Gorantyal and Ors. (2020) 7 SCC 1 held, in the
context of certificate required under Section
65B of the Evidence Act, 1872, that as per the
Latin maxim, lex non cogit ad impossibilia,
law does not demand the impossible. Thus, when
the ossification test cannot yield trustworthy
and reliable results, such test cannot be made
a basis to determine the age of the person
concerned on the date of incident. Therefore,
in the absence of any reliable trustworthy
medical evidence to find out age of the
appellant, the ossification test conducted in
year 2020 when the appellant was 55 years of
age cannot be conclusive to declare him as a
juvenile on the date of the incident.”
29. What emerges on a cumulative consideration of
the aforesaid catena of judgments is as follows:42
(i) A claim of juvenility may be raised at any
stage of a criminal proceeding, even after
a final disposal of the case. A delay in
raising the claim of juvenility cannot be
a ground for rejection of such claim. It
can also be raised for the first time
before this Court.
(ii) An application claiming juvenility could
be made either before the Court or the JJ
Board.
(iia) When the issue of juvenility arises before
a Court, it would be under sub-section (2)
and (3) of section 9 of the JJ Act, 2015
but when a person is brought before a
Committee or JJ Board, section 94 of the
JJ Act, 2015 applies.
(iib) If an application is filed before the
Court claiming juvenility, the provision
of sub-section (2) of section 94 of the JJ
Act, 2015 would have to be applied or read
along with sub-section (2) of section 9 so43
as to seek evidence for the purpose of
recording a finding stating the age of the
person as nearly as may be.
(iic) When an application claiming juvenility is
made under section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015
before the JJ Board when the matter
regarding the alleged commission of
offence is pending before a Court, then
the procedure contemplated under section
94 of the JJ Act, 2015 would apply. Under
the said provision if the JJ Board has
reasonable grounds for doubt regarding
whether the person brought before it is a
child or not, the Board shall undertake
the process of age determination by
seeking evidence and the age recorded by
the JJ Board to be the age of the person
so brought before it shall, for the
purpose of the JJ Act, 2015, be deemed to
be true age of that person. Hence the
degree of proof required in such a
proceeding before the JJ Board, when an
application is filed seeking a claim of44
juvenility when the trial is before the
concerned criminal court, is higher than
when an inquiry is made by a court before
which the case regarding the commission
of the offence is pending (vide section 9
of the JJ Act, 2015).
(iii) That when a claim for juvenility is
raised, the burden is on the person
raising the claim to satisfy the Court to
discharge the initial burden. However, the
documents mentioned in Rule 12(3)(a)(i),
(ii), and (iii) of the JJ Rules 2007 made
under the JJ Act, 2000 or sub-section (2)
of section 94 of JJ Act, 2015, shall be
sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of
the Court. On the basis of the aforesaid
documents a presumption of juvenility may
be raised.
(iv) The said presumption is however not
conclusive proof of the age of juvenility
and the same may be rebutted by contra
evidence let in by the opposite side.45
(v) That the procedure of an inquiry by a
Court is not the same thing as declaring
the age of the person as a juvenile sought
before the JJ Board when the case is
pending for trial before the concerned
criminal court. In case of an inquiry, the
Court records a prima facie conclusion but
when there is a determination of age as
per sub-section (2) of section 94 of 2015
Act, a declaration is made on the basis of
evidence. Also the age recorded by the JJ
Board shall be deemed to be the true age
of the person brought before it. Thus, the
standard of proof in an inquiry is
different from that required in a
proceeding where the determination and
declaration of the age of a person has to
be made on the basis of evidence
scrutinised and accepted only if worthy of
such acceptance.
(vi) That it is neither feasible nor desirable
to lay down an abstract formula to46
determine the age of a person. It has to
be on the basis of the material on record
and on appreciation of evidence adduced by
the parties in each case.
(vii) This Court has observed that a hyper-
technical approach should not be adopted
when evidence is adduced on behalf of the
accused in support of the plea that he was
a juvenile.
(viii) If two views are possible on the same
evidence, the court should lean in favour
of holding the accused to be a juvenile in
borderline cases. This is in order to
ensure that the benefit of the JJ Act,
2015 is made applicable to the juvenile in
conflict with law. At the same time, the
Court should ensure that the JJ Act, 2015
is not misused by persons to escape
punishment after having committed serious
offences.47
(ix) That when the determination of age is on
the basis of evidence such as school
records, it is necessary that the same
would have to be considered as per Section
35 of the Indian Evidence Act, inasmuch as
any public or official document maintained
in the discharge of official duty would
have greater credibility than private
documents.
(x) Any document which is in consonance with
public documents, such as matriculation
certificate, could be accepted by the
Court or the JJ Board provided such public
document is credible and authentic as per
the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act
viz., section 35 and other provisions.
(xi) Ossification Test cannot be the sole
criterion for age determination and a
mechanical view regarding the age of a
person cannot be adopted solely on the
basis of medical opinion by radiological
examination. Such evidence is not48
conclusive evidence but only a very useful
guiding factor to be considered in the
absence of documents mentioned in Section
94(2) of the JJ Act, 2015.
30. Bearing in mind the aforesaid position of
law, the same could be applied to the facts of the
present case. It is noted that in the FIR dated
05.05.2020, the name of respondent no.2 has been
written as Nishu and it has been stated that Nishu
S/o Bhushan and other accused were carrying a
Farsa (battle-axe), lathi and balkaties (cane-
knives) and attacked the complainant/ appellant
herein and the members of his family (Annexure P-
1).
31. An application being Misc. Case No.16/2020
filed on behalf of respondent no.2 Nishant before
the JJ Board, Baghpat, was for a declaration that
respondent no.2 was a juvenile delinquent and that
he was approximately 15 years 8 months of age on
the date of commission of the alleged offences
i.e. 05.05.2020. No such application was filed
before the competent Sessions Court.49
32. Be that as it may. In support of the aforesaid
application, Certificate-cum-Marks Sheet of the
High School issued by the Board of High School and
Intermediate Examination U.P., was produced
stating that the date of birth of respondent no.2
Nishant was 25.09.2004 and that he had passed the
High School Examination held in February, 2019.
The said certificate is dated 27.04.2019.
33. It was stated by the mother of respondent no.2
that birth certificate of respondent no.2 was not
sought after his birth; that when the father of
respondent no.2 sought admission in class 1 in
Sarvoday Public School, Khindora, District
Baghpat, no document in respect of birth was given
at the time of admission in the school. The date
of birth was mentioned orally. That respondent
no.2 Nishant studied in Sarvoday Public School
upto Class 8 and thereafter, he was admitted in
another school viz., Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
Higher Secondary School, Shajarpur, Kaidna,
District Baghpat for class 9. The mother of
respondent no.2 in her cross examination has50
reiterated that the date of birth of respondent
no.2 was orally mentioned at the time of admission
of respondent no.2-Nishant in class 1 at Sarvoday
Public School and no document in support thereof
was submitted in the school.
34. DW-2 Manoj Kumar, Principal, Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel Higher Secondary School,
Shajarpur, Kaidna, District Baghpat, stated in his
deposition that respondent no.2 Nishant was
admitted to class 9 on 04.07.2017 and a transfer
certificate recording the date of birth of
respondent no.2 as 25.09.2004 was submitted and
the same was entered in the school records. All
the admission forms had to be signed by the
students and the guardians but the transfer
certificate from the previous school was not
verified.
35. Annexure P-11 is a copy of the Admission
Application Form of Sarvoday Public School,
Khindora, Baghpat, which is in Hindi, wherein
respondent no.2 has signed. Annexure P-12 is a
copy of the application form dated 03.04.201451
seeking admission to class 8. It is contended by
learned counsel for respondents that on a
comparison of the signatures of respondent no.2 on
Annexure P-11 and Annexure P-12, it is noted that
the signature on Annexure P-11 was made in the
year 2009, whereas, the signature on Annexure P-12
was made in the year 2014 and they are similar.
Further, it is not possible for a child seeking
admission to class 1 to sign his name on the
admission form.
36. DW-3 Surendra Kumar Saini, Principal,
Sarvoday Public School, Khindora, Baghpat, has
stated that respondent no.2 Nishant was a little
above four years of age at the time of admission
in class 1; that no photograph of Nishant was
affixed on the admission form nor was any document
of the previous school of Nishant submitted; that
Nishant studied in Sarvoday Public School from
class 1 to class 8 and after passing class 5,
admission form for class 6 had to be filled but
the same was not available in the file. He further
stated that the admission form dated 03.04.2014
which was duly signed by Nishant and his father52
was available on record and pertained to class 8.
He also admitted that the signature of Nishant on
admission forms of class 1 and class 8 are
identical but the said admission forms are not
fabricated.
37. The JJ Board, Baghpat, by its order dated
14.09.2020 dismissed the application seeking
medical examination of respondent no.2-Nishant
herein and there is nothing produced to show that
the same has been set aside. According to the JJ
Board, the matriculation certificate issued by the
concerned Board indicated the date of birth as
25.09.2004 and it is only in the absence of such a
document that determination of age had to be by
ossification test or any other latest medical age
determination test. In the instant case, since the
certificate of the matriculation Board was
available, it was unnecessary for orders for
medical test of Nishant.
38. Subsequently, the JJ Board by its order
dated 11.11.2020 allowed the application of
respondent no.1 being Misc. Case No.16/2020 filed53
on behalf of respondent no.2-Nishant. The JJ board
observed that letter dated 22.07.2020 issued by
the Office of the Administrative Officer, Regional
Office, Intermediate Education Council, Meerut,
UP, revealed that the date of birth of accused
Nishant had rightly been recorded as 25.09.2004 in
the High School mark-sheet. The date of the
incident was 05.05.2020. Hence respondent no.2
Nishant was 15 years and 8 months of age as on the
date of the incident.
39. By order dated 11.11.2020, the JJ Board
declared respondent no.2 Nishant as a juvenile
delinquent in Case Crime No.116 of 2020 for
offences under sections 147, 148, 149, 323, 307,
302 and 34 of the IPC P.S. Singhawali Ahir,
District Baghpat.
40. The aforesaid order has been sustained by the
District and Sessions Court as well as the High
Court by holding that section 94 of the JJ Act,
2015 had been complied with in the instant case
inasmuch as the matriculation or equivalent
certificate from the concerned Examination Board54
had indicated the date of birth of respondent no.2
Nishant to be 25.09.2004. Therefore, Sub-section 2
of Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 applies as there
were no reasonable ground to doubt the said
document. In the absence of there being any
evidence to negate the same, the criminal revision
was dismissed. This is on the strength of Sub-
section (3) of Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015
which is a deeming provision.
41. Though Mr. Dwivedi, learned counsel for the
appellant, emphasized that the signatures of
respondent no.2-Nishant on the admission forms of
class 1 and class 8 are identical and it could not
be so on the admission form of class 1 as Nishant
was only four and half years old when he was
admitted to class 1. But the fact remains that in
2019, when Nishant completed his class 10, his
date of birth has been shown as 25.09.2004 in the
matriculation certificate. Hence, respondent no.2
was only about 15 years of age on the date of
incident, and in any case he was less than 16
years of age.55
42. In the absence of there being any rebuttal
evidence brought on record by the appellant
herein, even if the documents seeking admission to
class 1 and class 8 are discredited or eschewed,
the fact remains that the mark-sheet pertaining to
the matriculation of Nishant, issued by the
concerned Board, gives rise to a presumption that
Nishant was less than 16 years of age on the date
of incident i.e.05.05.2020. Moreover, the letter
dated 22.07.2020 of the Administrative Officer,
Regional Office, Intermediate Education Council,
UP, reveals his age as 25.09.2004.
43. There are two considerations which would
distinguish the judgment in Sanjeev Kumar Gupta.
Firstly, in Sanjeev Kumar Gupta, this Court held
that, though, there was no underlying document
corroborating the CBSE record maintained on the
basis of final list of the document forwarded by
the secondary school, there was clear and
unimpeachable evidence of date of birth which had
been recorded in the records of the school which
the second respondent therein had attended till
class 4 and which was supported by voluntary56
disclosure made by the accused therein while
obtaining both Aadhaar Card and Driving Licence.
44. In the instant case, Ex- P-11 and 12 have
been relied upon to prove that the date of birth
of respondent no. 2 mentioned in the said
documents are in consonance with the date of birth
indicated in the matriculation certificate.
Although, learned counsel for the respondents
contended that Ex- P-11 and 12 cannot be relied
upon, the fact remains that a photocopy of the
High School marksheet of accused Nishant with
Gazette year 2019, Roll No.0485064 year 2019, in
respect of which a letter of verification being
No.R.O.I.E.C./records/4016 dated 22.07.2020,
received from the Office of the Administrative
Officer, Regional Office, Intermediate Education
Council, Uttar Pradesh (Meerut) also authenticated
the date of birth of accused Nishant as
25.09.2004. Moreover, the said matriculation
certificate has been issued by the concerned
Board. Further, the date of birth as recorded in
the school admission records, as well as the
matriculation certificate are the same namely,57
25.09.2004. The incident occurred on 05.05.2020.
Thus respondent no.2 was only 15 years 7 months of
age on the date of the incident which in any case
is less than 16 years of age.
45. Secondly, in Sanjeev Kumar Gupta, the High
Court had reversed the findings of the Sessions
Judge on the basis of the matriculation
certificate by holding the said certificate would
have precedence over any other document. The same
was reversed by this Court as the Aadhaar Card,
Voter’s ID and Eighth standard marksheet indicated
the date of birth of the second respondent therein
as 27.12.1995 whereas, matriculation certificate
indicated the date of birth as 17.12.1998. And,
according to the medical report, it was opined
that the second respondent was nineteen years of
age on 09.11.2016, when the alleged offences were
said to have committed by him in the said case.
46. But in the instant case, admittedly, there
is no other document indicating the date of birth
of the second respondent contrary to what has been
indicated in the matriculation certificate. Thus,58
such a discrepancy in the date of birth does not
arise herein. No contra evidence to the documents
produced by the second respondent have been
produced by the appellant herein. In the
circumstances, we are not inclined to differ from
the order of the High court which sustained the
judgment of the District & Sessions Court as well
as of the JJ Board in this case.
47. Section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 raises a
presumption regarding juvenility of the age of the
child brought before the JJ board or the
Committee. But in case the Board or Committee has
reasonable grounds for doubt about the person
brought before it is a child or not, it can
undertake the process of determination of age by
seeking evidence. Thus, in the initial stage a
presumption that the child brought before the
Committee or the JJ Board is a juvenile has to be
drawn by the said authorities. The said
presumption has to be drawn on observation of the
child. However, the said presumption may not be
drawn when the Committee or the Board has
reasonable grounds for doubt regarding the person59
brought before it is a child or not. In such a
case, it can undertake the process of age
determination by the evidence which can be in the
form of:
(i) Date of birth certificate from the school
or the matriculation certificate from the
concerned board, if available or in the
absence thereof;
(ii) The birth certificate given by a
corporation or by a municipal authority or a
panchayat and in the absence of the above;
(iii) Age has to be determined by an
ossification test or any other medical age
determination test conducted on the orders of
the committee or the board.
48. The age recorded by the Committee or the
Board to be the age of the person so brought
before it shall for the purpose of the JJ Act,
2015 be deemed to be the true age of the person.
The deeming provision in sub-section (3) of
section 94 of the JJ Act, 2015 is also significant
inasmuch as the controversy or the doubt regarding
the age of the child brought before the Committee60
or the JJ Board is sought to be set at rest at the
level of the JJ Board or the Committee itself.
49. In the circumstances, we find no merit in
the instant appeal and the same is dismissed.
50. Pending interlocutory applications, if any,
stand disposed.
