hostile. In spite of summons issued to other witnesses, none appeared. By a detailed
order dated 19/4/2000, the trial Court, after noticing the facts and non-appearance of
witnesses, closed the prosecution evidence. Thereafter the statement of the accused
was recorded and the trial Court proceeded to judgment. The grievance of the
appellant that he was not notified of the position of the case and that he was not
summoned has no basis. In fact at the relevant point of time appellant himself was a
declared absconder in some other criminal case and surfaced only long after the
judgment of the trial Court in this matter. As the two witnesses who were examined
had turned hostile and no other witnesses were forthcoming in spite of issue of
summons and non-bailable warrants, the trial Court had no option but to proceed on
the basis of the evidence on record and acquit the respondents. The order dated
19/4/2000 of the trial Court shows that adequate steps were taken to secure the
presence of the witnesses and the High Court has also examined the entire matter and
found no ground to interfere.
4. In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed.
