As per the records, he will spend 12 years 3 months and 8
days in prison as on 31/07/2016.
His date of expiry of substantive sentence falls on
19-08-2022 without any remission. He has already earned 3
years 10 months 27 days remission as on 26-05-16. He has to
pay fine of Rs.18,000/- in various cases in default he has to
undergo 1 year 5 months in Jail.
Yours faithfully,
Sd/-
Director General of Prisons &
Correctional Services”
4. According to the aforesaid communication, the appellant stands
convicted and sentenced in 12 different matters including the present matters
which appear at Serial Nos.9, 10, 11 and 12 in the chart. Going by the
Page 78
sentence calculation, the sentence in the 9th case would begin on 30.08.2017
and finally, the sentence in the 12th case, after getting all benefits of set off,
would be over on 02.09.2022.
5. Section 427 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 is as under:-
“427. Sentence on offender already sentenced for
another offence. – (1) When a person already undergoing a
sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent
conviction to imprisonment or imprisonment for life, such
imprisonment or imprisonment for life shall commence at the
expiration of the imprisonment to which he has been previously
sentenced, unless the Court directs that the subsequent sentence
shall run concurrently with such previous sentence:
Provided that where a person who has been sentenced to
imprisonment by an order under Section 122 in default of
furnishing security is, whilst undergoing such sentence,
sentenced to imprisonment for an offence committed prior to
the making of such order, the latter sentence shall commence
immediately.
(2)When a person already undergoing a sentence of
imprisonment for life is sentenced on a subsequent conviction
to imprisonment for a term or imprisonment for life, the
subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with such previous
sentence.”
6. In terms of sub-section (1) of Section 427, if a person already
undergoing a sentence of imprisonment is sentenced on a subsequent
conviction to imprisonment, such subsequent term of imprisonment would
normally commence at the expiration of the imprisonment to which he was
previously sentenced. Going by this normal principle, the sentence chart
Page 89
indicated in the communication dated 27.05.2016 is quite correct. However
this normal rule is subject to a qualification and it is within the powers of the
Court to direct that the subsequent sentence shall run concurrently with the
previous sentence.
7. In V.K.Bansal v. State of Haryana and Another1 it was stated by this
Court:
“It is manifest from Section 427(1) that the Court has the
power and the discretion to issue a direction but in the very
nature of the power so conferred upon the Court the
discretionary power shall have to be exercised along the judicial
lines and not in a mechanical, wooden or pedantic manner. It is
difficult to lay down any straitjacket approach in the matter of
exercise of such discretion by the courts. There is no cut and
dried formula for the Court to follow in the matter of issue or
refusal of a direction within the contemplation of Section
427(1). Whether or not a direction ought to be issued in a given
case would depend upon the nature of the offence or offences
committed, and the fact situation in which the question of
concurrent running of the sentences arises.”
This Court then went on to club various crimes in respect of which
sentences were imposed upon the appellant therein in three groups; i) the
first having 12 cases, ii) the second having 2 cases and iii) the third having a
single case. This Court directed that substantive sentences within first two
groups would run inter se concurrently and the substantive sentences in first
two groups and that in respect of the case in the third group would run
1
(2013) 7 SCC 211
Page 910
consecutively. The benefit was confined only in respect of substantive
sentences and no qua sentences in default.
8. We have gone through the record and considered rival submissions.
We do not find anything incorrect in the assessment made by the Courts
below and in our view the orders of conviction recorded against the
appellant in the present cases are quite correct. We also do not find anything
wrong in the quantum of sentence imposed in respect of the respective
crimes. However going by the sentence calculation, the sentence imposed in
respect of the first crime started with effect from 20.11.2003 and the last
sentence would be over by 19.08.2022, which would effectively mean that
the total length of sentences in aggregate would be around 19 years. We are
not concerned with first eight matters and sentences imposed in respect of
those crimes. The sentence in respect of 8th crime is presently running
against the appellant and would be over on 30.08.2017.
9. The maximum sentence in respect of the present crimes is two years’
rigorous imprisonment. As per the record, these crimes were committed on
the same day. Having considered the matters, we deem it appropriate to
direct that the sentences imposed in each of the cases, i.e. (i) CC No.158 of
2004, (ii) CC No. 1039 of 2003, (iii) CC No. 390 of 2004 and (iv) CC No.
1168 of 2006 namely those at Sl.Nos.9 to 12 respectively as indicated in the
Page 1011
sentence chart in the communication dated 27.05.2016 shall run concurrently
with the sentence imposed in Crime No.8 which is currently operative. We
grant this benefit in respect of substantive sentences to the appellant but
maintain the sentences of fine and the default sentences. If the fine as
imposed is not deposited, the default sentence or sentences will run
consecutively and not concurrently.
10. The appeals are thus allowed in part and the orders of sentences stand
modified accordingly.
