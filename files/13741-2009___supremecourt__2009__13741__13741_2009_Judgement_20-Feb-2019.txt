CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 698 OF 2010
THANGASAMY Appellant(s)
VS.
THE STATE OF TAMIL NADU Respondent(s)
JUDGMENT
Dinesh Maheshwari, J
In this appeal, the appellant-accused has called in question the
judgment and order dated 07.01.2009 in Crl. R.C. No. 232 of 2006 whereby,
the Madras High Court at its Madurai Bench, while dismissing the criminal
revision petition, has upheld the conviction of the appellant for offences under
Sections 279, 337(3 counts) and 304-A (4 counts) of the Indian Penal Code
('IPC').
2. Put in brief, the accusation against the appellant had been that on
24.02.2001 at about 07:15 p.m., while driving a government passenger bus
bearing registration No. TN-72-N-0891 in a negligent manner, he caused an
accident near Korampallam on Tuticorin-Tirunelveli Main Road, which resulted
in the death of four persons namely, Jayaraj, Muniasamy, Gopal and Dharma
Nadar whereas three persons namely, Murugan, Senthur Pandian and
1Krishnan were injured. For the incident in question, FIR came to be registered
as Crime No. 70 of 2001; and after investigation, the accused was charge-
sheeted for the offences as aforesaid.
3. In trial, the prosecution, inter alia, relied on the testimony of PW-1
Chellathrai (the informant), who asserted that at the time of the accident, he
was standing near Thangaiah STD booth and saw the accused driving the
offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, without even blowing the
horn; and having caused the accident whereby, four out of five persons, who
were standing near the booth, came beneath the vehicle and those four
persons succumbed to their injuries whereas, the fifth person was taken to the
hospital. PW-2 Samadhana Raj, who had a cycle shop on Korampallam main
road, corroborated the testimony of PW-1 and stated that Dharamraj, Gopal,
Jayraj etc. had come to his shop to fix a puncture and they were standing on
the mud side of the road when the vehicle in question came at a fast speed
from Tirunelveli and dashed against them; that a TVS 50 vehicle also came
under the offending vehicle; and that he helped the injured to reach the
hospital. PW-3 Adhisaya Pandi, who was taking tea at a nearby place, further
corroborated the testimonies of PW-1 and PW-2. Moreover, PW-4 Murugan,
also a victim of the accident, testified that while he was standing and talking to
Muniasamy, Dharma, Senthur Pandian and Murugan, a government bus,
which was over-speeding from the right side, caused the accident. This
witness also stated that the driver of the bus left the vehicle and fled away
from the scene of the accident. PW-5 Senthur Pandian, the only surviving
2member of the five who came beneath the bus, testified in the same manner
as PW-4. He, of course, stated in the cross examination that the driver of the
offending bus having ran away, his identity was not known. However, in the
examination-in-chief this witness stated thus: "The person who drove the bus
is the accused here. He alighted and went away." This witness also deposed
in the cross-examination that a lorry from the opposite direction of the bus
came fast after overtaking a bullock cart; and that southern side of the road in
question had a slope and any vehicle taking to that side of the road would turn
upside down.
4. The accused-appellant attempted to suggest that there was neither any
oral evidence nor any documentary proof that he was driving the bus and had
caused the accident; and that, since the driver of the bus allegedly fled from
the scene, his identification was a matter of serious doubt.
5. In its order dated 24.09.2004 in C.C. No. 205 of 2001, on appreciation
of evidence, the Trial Court rejected the contentions urged on behalf of the
accused and found it proved that he did cause the accident which resulted in
the death of four persons apart from causing injuries to three. Accordingly, the
Trial Court convicted and sentenced the accused-appellant for the offences
under Sections 279, 337 (3 counts) and 304-A (4 counts) in the following
manner:
"14A. Finally, in the light of the evidence that was
elicited in the case and the documents marked and
the material objects produced and after analysing the
evidence, I have come to the conclusion that the
charges laid against he accused have been proved
3and hold him guilty under Sections 279, 337 IPC (3
counts) and Section 304-A IPC (4 counts). Therefore,
I impose a fine of Rs. 200/- and in default one month
imprisonment for the offence under Section 279 IPC,
Rs. 100/- for each count of the offence under Section
337 IPC (3 counts) and in default one month
imprisonment, four months imprisonment for the
offence under Section 304-A IPC (4 counts) for each
count. I order that the accused will serve the
sentences simultaneously. The total fine is Rs. 500/-"
6. The appeal preferred by the accused-appellant against the judgment
and order aforesaid, being Criminal Appeal No. 91 of 2004, was considered
and dismissed by the Sessions Judge, Tuticorin in the judgment dated
28.11.2005, after re-examination of the entire evidence on record.
7. Against the judgment aforesaid, the accused-appellant filed a revision
petition, being Crl.R.C. No. 232 of 2006, before the Madras High Court,
Madurai Bench which was also dismissed by the impugned order dated
07.01.2009. The High Court approved the conviction and sentencing of the
appellant while observing as under:
"11. It has already been pointed out that due to
accident four persons have passed away and three
others have sustained injuries. Considering the
nature of the accident and also considering that four
persons have lost their lives, it is needless to say that
no leniency can be shown in awarding sentence
against the revision petitioner/accused.
12. The courts below, after evaluating all the evidence
available on record, have rightly found that the
accused has committed offences under Sections 279,
337 (3 counts) and 304-A (4 counts) of the Indian
Penal Code and in view of the discussion made
earlier, this court has not found even a filmsy ground
to impinge the concurrent judgments passed by the
courts below and altogether the present criminal
revision case deserves dismissal."
48. Assailing the order aforesaid, learned counsel for the accused-appellant
has contended that the orders passed by the High Court as also the sub-
ordinate Courts are contrary to law and that the order of conviction was
passed while completely ignoring the portion of the statements of PW-4 and
PW-5 wherein, they had also deposed that the accident had occurred due to
rash and negligent driving of a lorry coming from the opposite direction; and
further that the bus had to swerve to north instead of going south, since there
was a valley like slope on the southern plank of the road. Learned counsel has
further submitted that the identity of the driver of the bus remained doubtful, as
could be noticed from the testimony of prosecution witnesses, who admit that
the driver of the bus had immediately fled from the scene of the accident and,
for want of identification parade, the testimony of the alleged eye-witnesses
could not have been relied upon as regards identity of the appellant. The
learned counsel would submit that without strict proof of the identity of the bus
driver, the appellant could not have been convicted in this case. The learned
counsel would also pray for waiving of the sentence of imprisonment with
reference to the passage of time and the circumstances of the case. Per
contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State has duly supported the order
impugned and has submitted that looking to the gravity of the offence, no case
for any interference is made out.
9. Having given anxious consideration to the rival submissions and having
examined the record with reference to the law applicable, we find no reason to
show any interference in this matter at the instance of the appellant.
510. The grounds on which the appellant seeks exoneration in this case are
twofold: one, that there was no evidence to prove that he was driving the bus
involved in the accident; and second, in the alternative, that the incident in
question took place for the reason of the vehicle from the opposite side
approaching in a negligent manner and if the driver of the bus in question had
not taken to the northern side, the passengers of the bus would have been at
the greater risk because of a valley like slope on the southern plank of the
road. The submissions remain totally bereft of substance.
11. So far the question of identity of the appellant as driver of the offending
bus is concerned, the Trial Court, the Appellate Court and then the High Court
have found the fact duly proved with reference to the overwhelming evidence
on record, including the testimony of PW1 to PW5. In this regard, the
observations of the Appellate Court could be usefully taken note of as under:-
“... Regarding the submissions of the defence that the
prosecution witnesses could not tell who actually was
driving the bus because PWs 1 to 5 could not
establish during their cross-examination that the
accused was a driver and that they had stated that
the driver ran away and they did not know who was
the driver. But the trial court which examined this
submission in the light of the testimonies and other
necessary evidence, has held that PWs 1 to 5 had
identified the accused as the person who was driving
the bus No. TN-72-0891 and that the accused was
present in the court and accordingly identified him. In
view of this, this court rejects the arguments of the
appellant-accused.”
12. The suggestion that the accident in question occurred for the fault of the
on-coming vehicle from the opposite direction has also been rejected with
6reference to the evidence on record wherein the witness, including the injured
persons, uniformly stated that the accident occurred for rash and negligent
driving of the offending vehicle by the appellant.
13. The contentions urged before this Court essentially relate to the
appreciation of evidence. Having regard to the contentions urged, we have
examined the material placed on record in this appeal and find nothing of
infirmity in the appreciation of evidence by the sub-ordinate Courts and by the
High Court, who have concurrently reached to the definite conclusion that the
accident occurred for rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by the appellant
that resulted in the death of four persons apart from causing injuries to three.
The devastation in terms of casualties and injuries, as brought about by the
appellant, was bound to result in his conviction for the offences under
Sections 304-A IPC (four counts) and 337 IPC (three counts).
14. So far the plea for reducing the period of imprisonment is concerned,
the same has only been noted to be rejected. In this regard, we may usefully
refer to the decision of this Court in Alister Anthony Pareira v. State of
Maharashtra: (2012) 2 SCC 648 wherein, the allegations against the
appellant had been that while driving a car in drunken condition, he ran over
the pavement, killing 7 persons and causing injuries to 8. He was charged for
the offences under Sections 304 Part II and 338 IPC; was ultimately convicted
by the High Court under Sections 304 Part II, 338 and 337 IPC; and was
sentenced to 3 years' rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 5 lakhs for the
offence under Section 304 Part II IPC and to rigorous imprisonment for 1 year
7and for 6 months respectively for the offences under Section 338 and 337
IPC. Apart from other contentions, one of the pleas before this Court was that
in view of fine and compensation already paid and willingness to make further
payment as also his age and family circumstances, the appellant may be
released on probation or his sentence may be reduced to that already
undergone. As regards this plea for modification of sentence, this Court
traversed through the principles of penology, as enunciated in several of the
past decisions including those in State of M.P. v. Ghansyam Singh: (2003) 8
SCC 13 as also in Dalbir Singh v. State of Haryana: (2000) 5 SCC 82; and,
while observing that the facts and circumstances of the case show 'a
despicable aggravated offence warranting punishment proportionate to the
crime', this Court found no justification for extending the benefit of probation or
for reduction of sentence. On the question of sentencing, this Court re-
emphasised as follows:-
"84. Sentencing is an important task in the matters of
crime. One of the prime objectives of the criminal law
is imposition of appropriate, adequate, just and
proportionate sentence commensurate with the nature
and gravity of crime and the manner in which the crime
is done. There is no straitjacket formula for sentencing
an accused on proof of crime. The courts have
evolved certain principles: the twin objective of the
sentencing policy is deterrence and correction. What
sentence would meet the ends of justice depends on
the facts and circumstances of each case and the
court must keep in mind the gravity of the crime,
motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other
attendant circumstances.
85. The principle of proportionality in sentencing a
crime-doer is well entrenched in criminal
jurisprudence. As a matter of law, proportion between
8crime and punishment bears most relevant influence in
determination of sentencing the crime-doer. The court
has to take into consideration all aspects including
social interest and consciousness of the society for
award of appropriate sentence.’’
(underlining supplied for emphasis)
15. It shall also be apposite to recapitulate the observations of this Court in
the case of Dalbir Singh (supra), guarding against leniency in relation to the
drivers found guilty of rash driving, in the following passages:
"1. When automobiles have become death traps any
leniency shown to drivers who are found guilty of rash
driving would be at the risk of further escalation of
road accidents. All those who are manning the
steering of automobiles, particularly professional
drivers, must be kept under constant reminders of
their duty to adopt utmost care and also of the
consequences befalling them in cases of dereliction.
One of the most effective ways of keeping such
drivers under mental vigil is to maintain a deterrent
element in sentencing sphere. Any latitude shown to
them in that sphere would tempt them to make driving
frivolous and frolic.
*** *** ***
13. Bearing in mind the galloping trend in road
accidents in India and the devastating consequences
visiting the victims and their families, criminal courts
cannot treat the nature of the offence under Section
304-A IPC as attracting the benevolent provisions of
Section 4 of the PO Act. While considering the
quantum of sentence to be imposed for the offence of
causing death by rash or negligent driving of
automobiles, one of the prime considerations should
be deterrence. A professional driver pedals the
accelerator of the automobile almost throughout his
working hours. He must constantly inform himself that
he cannot afford to have a single moment of laxity or
inattentiveness when his leg is on the pedal of a
vehicle in locomotion……. He must always keep in
his mind the fear psyche that if he is convicted of the
9offence for causing death of a human being due to his
callous driving of vehicle he cannot escape from jail
sentence. This is the role which the courts can play,
particularly at the level of trial courts, for lessening the
high rate of motor accidents due to callous driving of
automobiles.’'
(underlining supplied for emphasis)
16. We may also usefully refer to a decision of this Court in the case of State
of Karnataka v. Muralidhar : (2009) 4 SCC 463, wherein, for rash and
negligent driving, the respondent caused accident resulting in demise of a 16
year old boy while another person sustained grievous injuries. The Trial Court
sentenced the respondent to six months imprisonment and to a fine of Rs.
1,000/- with default stipulation for offence under Section 338 IPC and to
rigorous imprisonment for one year with fine of Rs. 5,000/- with default
stipulation for the offence under Section 304-A IPC. The appeal was
dismissed by the Sessions Court. However, the High Court waived custodial
sentence and only fines were imposed. This Court referred to the principles
related with the offence under Section 304-A IPC as also the problems
associated with the road traffic injuries and found absolutely no reason that
the High Court waived the custodial sentence awarded to the respondent.
Hence, the impugned judgment of the high Court was set aside and that of the
Trial Court restored.
17. In the light of the principles aforesaid, when we examine the facts of the
present case, it is noticed that for rash and negligent driving by the appellant,
as many as four persons died and three other sustained injuries. Yet, the Trial
Court had been considerate in awarding the sentence only of four months'
10imprisonment for each count of the offence under Section 304-A IPC and only
of fine of Rs. 100 for each count of the offence under Section 337 IPC and Rs.
200/- for the offence under Section 279 IPC. To say the least, the punishment
awarded in this matter had been rather on the lower side. There being no
appeal for enhancement of sentence and looking to the time that has elapsed,
we would not be making any further comment in the matter. Suffice it to
conclude that no case for reducing the punishment awarded to the appellant is
made out.
18. Accordingly, and in view of the above, this appeal fails and is, therefore,
dismissed. The appellant shall surrender before the Court concerned within a
period of 4 weeks from today and shall undergo the remaining part of the
sentence. In case he fails to surrender within the period aforesaid, the Trial
Court will take necessary steps to ensure that he serves out the remaining
part of sentence, of course, after due adjustment of the period already
undergone.
