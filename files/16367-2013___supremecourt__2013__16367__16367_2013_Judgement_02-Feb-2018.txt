CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. 215-217 OF 2018
[@ SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CRL.) NOS. 5682-5684 OF 2013]
STATE OF KARNATAKA Appellant(s)
VERSUS
KAISARBAIG & ORS. Respondent(s)

KURIAN, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The State is before this Court, aggrieved by the
Judgment dated 22.06.2012 in an appeal filed under
Section 374(2) Cr.P.C. The respondents-accused are
charged for committing offences under Sections 147,
148, 323, 504, 307 read with Section 149 IPC. On
conviction, they were sentenced to undergo
imprisonment for a period of three years.
3. Having considered the nature of injuries, the
High Court converted the conviction to Sections 148
and 324 read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced them
to fine of Rs. 3,000/- each under Section 148 with a
default sentence and fine of Rs. 10,000/- each under
Section 324 with default sentence. The fine amount
was directed to be paid to the victim – PW5.2
4. The learned counsel for the respondents has
brought to our notice that the accused have already
undergone some period in jail. Apparently, this was
in the mind of the High Court while reducing the
sentence, in addition to the submission made by the
learned counsel for the respondents, that the parties
have since purchased peace.
5. Having heard the learned counsel for the State
and the parties, though this Court is also of the
view that the punishment, as ordered by the High
Court, is too low, however, having regard to the fact
that the respondents have already undergone some
period in jail and taking note of the fact that the
incident occurred in the year 2007 and since the
parties have purchased peace, we are of the view, in
the peculiar facts of this case, that no further
sentence of incarceration needs to be imposed.
However, the respondents-accused should be visited
with a higher amount of fine, which shall be paid to
the victim.
6. Accordingly, these appeals are disposed of,
imposing a total fine of Rs. 50,000/- (Rupees Fifty
Thousand) in addition to what has already been paid
to the victim. This amount shall be paid by the3
respondents-accused to the victim – PW5 within a
period of three months from today and in that regard,
the amount shall be deposited in the trial court
within a period of two months from today. In the
event of default, the respondents-accused shall
undergo imprisonment for a period of three months.
