3. The factual position need not be gone into in detail in view of order
proposed to be passed.
4. The accused faced trial for alleged commission of offence punishable
under Section 302 IPC. It was the prosecution version that in the course of
sudden quarrel, the accused attacked Lakshmi (hereinafter referred to as the
’deceased’) who was stated to be the second wife of one Samuvel. On
10.12.1994 the occurrence occurred. The accused faced trial and as noted
above was convicted by the trial court. The appeal before the High Court
was admitted considering the various grounds of challenge raised by the
appellant. It appears from the impugned order of the High Court that the
appellant’s counsel did not appear when the matter was taken up and after
hearing learned Additional Prosecutor, the appeal was disposed of.
5. It was pointed out learned counsel for the appellant that because of
various difficulties the appellant’s counsel could not appear and more
particularly neither the appellant nor his counsel had any knowledge that the
matter was to be taken up before the Madurai Bench of the High Court.
26. Learned counsel for the respondent-State on the other hand submitted
that the appellant and her counsel ought to have been more vigilant.
7. While issuing notice on 23.7.2007, it was indicated that the matter
may be remitted for fresh hearing because the appellant was not represented
when the matter was taken up by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High
Court.
8. Considering the difficulties highlighted by the appellant to explain
non-appearance of the counsel we are satisfied that this is a fit case where
the High Court should re-hear the matter.
9. We have not expressed any opinion on the merits of the case. We set
aside the impugned judgment and remit the matter to the High Court for
fresh hearing.
10. The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent.
