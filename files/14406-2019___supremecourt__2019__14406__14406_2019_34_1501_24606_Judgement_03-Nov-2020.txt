Station Sadar, Rohtak. The complainant stated that his elder son Sandeep was
studying in the final year of the LLB degree course in Maharishi Dayanand

University, Rohtak . On 26 December 2006, Sandeep had gone to the law
department in the University to prepare for the exams. The complainant’s son-in-
law had come to their house and was in a hurry to leave after meeting Sandeep.
They tried to contact Sandeep on his cell phone but were unable to get through.
The complainant and his younger son, Sunil, then proceeded on their motor-cycle
to the University. At about 2:30pm when they reached the parking in proximity to
the law department, they saw that 6 men standing under the tin sheds started
firing shots at Sandeep who was standing there. Sandeep was alleged to have
fallen down upon which the complainant and his son, Sunil, rushed towards the
spot. The three young men fled towards the Delhi road on a silver coloured
Pulsar make motor-cycle. The complainant stated that he had not noted the
registration number of the motor-cycle but could identify the assailants, if they
were brought before him. The complainant alleged that blood was oozing out
from the right foot, abdomen, arm, left temple and thigh of Sandeep. The
complainant also stated that Sandeep was taken to PGIMS, Rohtak by Parveen,
son of Zile Singh Hooda, and “another person” in a Santro car belonging to

hospital. The complainant, Azad Singh, stated that his son had strained relations
with some persons and those persons had killed him.

Ajay Hooda were apprehended and arraigned. Subsequently, accused Pehlad,
was also arraigned to face trial. The offence under Section 302 being triable
exclusively by the Court of Sessions, the two appellants were committed for trial
to the Sessions Judge, Rohtak by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, pursuant to an
order dated 25 September 2007. Subsequently, on the basis of the
supplementary charge-sheet presented against accused Pehlad, he was also
committed to the Court of Sessions Judge by the JMFC on 31 March 2008. The
trials against all the three accused were consolidated by an order dated 12 April
2008. Charges were framed on 8 May 2008. All the accused pleaded that they
were not guilty. The prosecution examined 24 witnesses at the trial, as noted by
the judgment of the Sessions Court:

Learned Public Prosecutor for the State also tendered reports
of FSL Exhibits PD to PF in evidence. Thereafter, he closed
the evidence of the prosecution.”
3The reports of the Forensic Science Laboratory were marked as Exhibit PD-PF in
evidence. The accused were examined after the conclusion of the evidence of
the prosecution under Section 313 of the CrPC to explain the circumstances
which appeared against them in the evidence of the prosecution. They claimed
innocence and stated that they have been falsely implicated. One of the
appellants, Rajesh alias Sarkari, stated that the victim was implicated with him as
a co-accused in another case; that there was no dispute between them and that
his photographs have been published in the newspaper. The accused examined
5 witnesses in support of their defence as noted by the judgment of the Sessions
Court:
“11. …the accused have examined as many as five witnesses
namely Jiley Singh as DW1, Rajesh Jogpal, Record Keeper
as DW2, Shamsher Singh as DW3, Parveen as DW4 and
Sikander as DW5, in their defence evidence.”
4 During the course of the trial, PW1, Head Constable Karan Singh, deposed
that on 26 December 2006, he had joined the investigation of the case and
together with ASI, Meha Singh and others, had reached the scene of offence at
the University. He recovered seven empty cartridges, one lead and blood-stained
earth which were packed into a parcel and sealed. Among the other recoveries,
was a liquor bottle with some quantity of liquor. The principal eye witnesses
whose evidence was relied upon by the prosecution were the complainant (PW4-
Azad Singh) and his son (PW5-Sunil). PW4 stated that on 26 December 2006, he
and PW5 had proceeded to the University where Sandeep had gone to prepare
for his examinations, as Sandeep could not be contacted on his telephone. At
2:30 pm when they reached near the cycle-stand of the law department, they saw
4the car belonging to Sandeep parked there. Sandeep was standing under the
cycle shed together with three persons. When PW4 and PW5 were at a distance
of about 100 feet from Sandeep, they saw him being fired at with pistols or
revolvers. PW4 identified the appellants in Court as the assailants at the scene of
offence. All the three accused are stated to have departed from the scene after
executing the crime. PW4, in the course of his evidence, stated that thereafter, he
and PW5 took Sandeep to the Casualty Department of PGIMS, Rohtak in the
Santro car, where he was declared to be brought dead. The police were stated to
have reached the hospital and to have recorded his statement as Exhibit PB. The
deposition of PW5 was in similar terms. Significantly, both PW4 and PW5 stated
that they had removed Sandeep in his car to PGIMS, Rohtak which was at
variance with the FIR which recorded that Sandeep had been removed to the
hospital by “Parveen, son of Zile Singh Hooda, and by another person”. PW7-
Jagram, Sub-Inspector, deposed that ASI Meha Singh had deposited two sealed
parcels, one containing blood-stained earth and the other containing 7 empty
cartridges as well as one lead with him, which he subsequently forwarded to the
FSL, Madhuban on 8 January 2007. PW9- Sumit Kumar, Constable, prepared a
scaled site-plan marked as Exhibit PJ. PW10- Mahender Singh, SI, PW11-
Dharambir, ASI, SIT Crime Branch, Rohini, PW12-Constable Rajeev Godara,

Both PW10-Mahender Singh, SI and PW15-Ram Mehar Singh, retired Inspector,
stated that upon arrest, the appellants had refused to undergo a test identification
parade. In pursuance of the disclosure made by the accused Rajesh alias
Sarkari, the Pulsar motor-cycle bearing registration No. HR-10-H/2241 was
recovered from his residence on 24 June 2007 in Sector IV Bhiwari, Rajasthan.
PW19-Ram Kishan, SI, in the course of his deposition, stated that a pistol had
been recovered from the rented house of accused Rajesh alias Sarkari at Palam
Vihar, Gurgaon. PW19 also deposed to the recovery of a pistol from the rented
house of accused Ajay Hooda at village Carterpuri, Gurgaon. The recovery of the
fire arm at the behest of the accused was sought to be corroborated by the
evidence of PW20-Head Constable Jai Kishan and PW21- Meha Singh. PW21-
Meha Singh, a former Sub-Inspector, had received the ruqqa on 26 December
2006 from PGIMS, Rohtak. PW21 was a part of the police team which had
reached the scene of offence and had lifted seven empty cartridges and one lead
from the spot.
85 The FSL report dated 29 November 2007, marked as Exhibit PD, stated
that seven 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridges and one 7.62mm mauser pistol
fired bullet had been recovered from the place of occurrence; and two 7.62mm
deformed and mutilated fired bullets had been recovered from the body of the
deceased who had been fired at from a country made pistol. The pistol had been
received in an earlier FIR, being FIR No. 311 at Police Station, Civil Lines,
Rohtak and was stated to have been recovered from accused Rajesh alias
Sarkari.
6 Five defence witnesses, during the course of their deposition, stated:
(i) DW1- Zile Singh denied that he had let-out his house to accused Ajay
Hooda and stated that the police had not visited the house in connection
with any recovery. The witness stated that he had seen the accused Ajay
Hooda for the first time in Court;
(ii) DW2- Rajesh Jogpal, Record Keeper stated that accused Rajesh and the
deceased Sandeep had faced trial in a case arising out of the FIR No. 341
dated 23 June 2001 registered at Police Station, Civil Lines, Rohtak under
Sections 454/380 of the IPC. The case had been decided on 20
September 2008. Azad Singh, the complainant/PW4 had stood surety for
Sandeep in the said case;
(iii) DW3- Shamsher Singh, Executive Officer, Hari Bhumi Newspaper, Rohtak
stated that three news items regarding the incident were published in the
newspaper on 23 February 2007, 13 April 2007 and 1 July 2007;
9(iv) DW4- Parveen, s/o Zile Singh, deposed that on the date of the occurrence
he, together with Sikandar (DW5), was present along with Sandeep at the
cycle-stand of the law department at the University. Sandeep was
consuming alcohol while sitting in his car and after some time parked his
car inside the shed and sat down on the ground where he continued to
drink. After sometime, 5-6 persons came there on two motor-cycles and
fired indiscriminately upon Sandeep. Sandeep fell down in an injured
condition and was removed by DW4 and DW5 to PGIMS, Rohtak where he
was declared dead by the doctors on duty. DW4 stated that the father and
other relatives of Sandeep reached the mortuary about 10 to 15 minutes
after their arrival. The police came there and recorded his statement. DW4
stated that the father of the deceased (PW4) was not present at the scene
of the occurrence and the accused presented in the Court were not the
assailants who had fired shots at Sandeep; and
(v) DW5- Sikandar, s/o Ashok Rathi, deposed along similar lines to DW4 and
stated that he and DW4 had taken Sandeep to PGIMS, Rohtak and had
informed the father and brother of Sandeep of the occurrence, who had
accordingly reached PGIMS, Rohtak.
The FSL Reports, Exhibit DY, DY/1 and DY/2 were also tendered in the course of
the defence evidence.
7 The Sessions Court, by its judgment dated 12 June 2012, concluded that
there was a ring of truth to the case of the prosecution and that the appellants
were guilty of the offence of having committed the murder of Sandeep. The
10appellants and the co-accused Pehlad were, following their conviction under
Section 302 read with Section 34 of the IPC, sentenced to imprisonment for life.
Aggrieved by the judgment of the Sessions Court, all the three accused filed
appeals in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. By a judgment dated 17
January 2019, the High Court dismissed the appeals.
8 Leading the submission on behalf of the appellants, Mr Rakesh Khanna,
learned Senior Counsel urged the following submissions:
A PW4 and PW5 are not eye-witnesses
(i) PW4 and PW5 were not present at the scene of the offence and their
depositions stating that they were eye-witnesses to the occurrence are
untrustworthy;
(ii) The FIR which was lodged in close proximity to the occurrence of the
crime on the statement of PW4 clearly states that Sandeep was removed
to the hospital by Parveen, son of Zile Singh Hooda, and another person.
In the depositions of PW4 and PW5, there is a marked improvement when
they stated that both of them have accompanied the deceased who was in
an injured condition to PGIMS, Rohtak;
(iii) Parveen, son of Zile Singh Hooda, deposed as DW4 and confirmed that it
was he and Sikandar (DW5) who had taken Sandeep to the hospital. Both
DW4 and DW5 stated that PW4 and other relatives of the deceased
reached the mortuary after 10 to 15 minutes and neither PW4 nor PW5
were present at the scene of offence;
11(iv) The information(ruqqa) sent by the Causalty Medical Officer on 26
December 2006 records that the deceased Sandeep was brought to
PGIMS, Rohtak by “Sandeep Lehri, son of Zile Singh Hooda resident of
Kailash Colony, Rohtak”. The name ‘Sandeep’ Lehri is an inadvertent error
in place of ‘Parveen’ who is also described as the son of Zile Singh Hooda,
resident of Kailash Colony, Rohtak;
(v) The post-mortem report and the statement of PW14 indicates that injury
nos. 1, 5, 6, 10 and 11 showed blackening, charring and ecchymosis at the
margins. PW4 in his deposition has stated that the accused fired at
Sandeep from a distance of 4-5 feet. However, as explained in the
decision of this Court in State of Rajasthan v. Daud Khan7 , blackening of
injuries can only be observed if the pistol is fired from a very close range,
i.e., 2 feet or less. This indicates that PW4 and PW5 were not present at
the site; and
(vi) On the above grounds, it has been submitted that neither PW4 nor PW5
are eye-witnesses to the occurrence.

B The Forensic Science Laboratory report
(i) There are three FSL reports on the record – two relate to FIR No. 311 of
2006 and one pertaining to the present case which arises out of FIR No.
781 of 2006;
7 (2016) 2 SCC 607
8 FSL
12(ii) The first FSL report dated 12 March 2007 pertains to FIR No. 311 where
three parcels containing the clothes of injured persons, one 7.65mm fired
bullet taken from the body of an injured person by the name of Kuldeep,
four 7.65 mm fired pistol cartridge cases and one 7.65mm live pistol
cartridge were collected from the place of occurrence. After the FSL report
was prepared, the samples were resealed with the seal of L.S.Y (BALL)
FSL (H);
(iii) The second FSL report is dated 25 September 2007 in FIR No. 311. In the
description of parcels and the condition of seals, it has been stated that
four parcels were received: two with the seal of R.K. and two with the seal
of L.S.Y SOS (Ball) FSL (H). The first parcel contained a pistol chambered
for 7.65mm cartridges along with the magazine, one 7.65mm fired
cartridge case and one 7.65mm live cartridge stated to have been
recovered from the accused Rajesh. The pistol was marked W/1 and the
cartridge case was marked C/5. The second parcel contained one pistol
chambered for 7.62mm/0.30” cartridges along with magazine and one
7.62mm misfired cartridge stated to have been recovered from accused
Ajay. The pistol was marked W/2 and the misfired cartridge as MC/1. The
third parcel with the seal of L.S.Y SOS (Ball) FSL (H) contained one 7.65
mm fired bullet already marked as BC/1 in the earlier first FSL report dated
12 March 2007. The fourth parcel had a number and seal impression L.S.Y
SOS (Ball) FLS (H) and contained four 7.65mm fired cartridge cases and
one 7.65mm live cartridge (the fired cartridge cases were already marked
as C/1 to C/4 in the earlier first FSL report dated 12 March 2007);
13(iv) In the laboratory examination, it was stated that both the pistols were test
fired and that their firing mechanisms were found in working order. The
class as well as individual characteristic marks present on the 7.65mm
fired cartridge cases C/1 to C/5, 7.62mm / 0.30” misfired cartridge marked
MC/1, 7.65mm fired bullet BC/1 and those on the test fired cartridge cases
and bullets fired from pistols marked W/1 and W/2 were examined. In the
result, it was stated that pistols W/1 and W/2 were in working order. The
7.65mm cartridge case marked C/5 was found fired from pistol W/2.
However, the 7.65mm fired cases C/1 to C/4 and 7.65mm fired bullet
marked BC/1 were not fired from the pistol marked as W/1. In so far as the
7.62mm misfired cartridge MC/1 is concerned, it was found to be misfired
from pistol W/2. All the exhibits were resealed along with their original
wrappers with the seal of L.S.Y SSO (Ball) FSL (H). One 7.65mm cartridge
received in parcel No. 4 has been used in test firing in the laboratory; and
(v) The third FSL report dated 29 November 2007 pertains to FIR No. 781
lodged in the present case. In the description of articles, five parcels were
stated to have been received on 8 January 2007. According to the
submission, the receipt or description of parcels sealed by the ballistic
expert is not mentioned, as per his report dated 25 September 2007. The
first parcel inter alia contained blood stained earth, lifted from the place of
occurrence and sent for serological examination. The second parcel is
stated to contain seven 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridge cases and
one 7.62mm pistol fired bullet recovered from the place of occurrence
which were marked as C/1 to C/7 and BC/1 respectively. The third and
14fourth parcels contained blood stained clothes. The fifth parcel contain two
7.62mm deformed and mutilated fired bullets and two lead pieces stated to
have been recovered from the body of the deceased, marked as BC/2,
BC/3, BC/4 and BC/5. In the laboratory examination, it has been stated
that the individual characteristic marks present on the 7.62mm mauser
pistol fired cartridge cases marked as C/1 to C/7 and 7.62mm mauser
pistol fired bullets marks BC/1 to BC/3 and those on test cartridges and
test bullets fired from country made pistol W/2 (chambered for 7.62mm
cartridges), received in the second FSL report in connection with the FIR
No. 311 were examined. The lead pieces marked BC/4 and BC/5 in parcel
5 were also examined. The lead piece BC/4 was found to be a 0.455”
revolver bullet. No regular rifling marks were observed.
9 On the basis of the above narration, it has been submitted that:
(i) The parcel containing the pistol marked as W/2 and the test fired bullet,
sealed by the ballistic examiner as per the second FSL report dated 25
September 2007, admittedly had not been received and described in the
description of articles contained in the third FSL report dated 29 November
2007, arising from FIR No. 781 (present case);
(ii) There is no material on record to establish that it was brought to the notice
of the Assistant Director, RK Koshal, who examined the articles contained
in the parcels, about any connection of the parcels received for
examination, with the parcels examined in the second FSL report dated 25
September 2007;
15(iii) The description of the pistol in the second FSL report dated 25 September
2007 indicates that it is chambered for 7.62mm/0.30” cartridges. However,
the description of the cartridges received in the third FSL report in this
case is 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridge cases. The recovery memo in
regard to the place of occurrence refers to seven empties and one
cartridge bearing the description of S and B 7.62 X 25, whereas in the
second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 the description is 7.62mm /
0.30” cartridge; and
(iv) Though the author of the third FSL report dated 29 November 2007 states
that the cartridge cases marked C/1 to C/7 and the bullet marked BC/1 to
BC/3 had been fired from the country made pistol marked W/2, the said
pistol was never produced before the author of this report nor was any
information placed before him about the interconnection of pistol W/2 and
the cartridge cases to C/1 to C/7 or the fired bullets BC/1 to BC/3. The IO
of the present case, PW21, has, in the course of his cross-examination,
admitted that on the empty shells Exhibits P4 to P10, there was an
inscription 7.62K 25, which does not tally with the description recorded in
the second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 or the third FSL report
dated 29 November 2007.
10 On the basis of the above discrepancies, it has been urged on behalf of
the appellants that the prosecution has failed to establish that PW4 and PW5
were eye-witnesses at the scene of occurrence. Moreover, the prosecution has
failed to establish the correctness of the FSL report. The ballistics examiners
have not been examined in the course of the evidence tendered by the
16prosecution. The discrepancies in the FSL reports could have been explained in
the course of the examination by the FSL examiners. Their non-examination cuts
at the root of the case of the prosecution and would entitle the appellants to an
acquittal.
11 On the other hand, Mr Deepak Thukral, learned Standing Counsel
appearing on behalf of the Haryana, has opposed the submissions of the
appellants and submitted:
(i) As regards the presence of PW4 and PW5, the Sessions Court noted that
the deceased had sustained 13 injuries as a result of the fire arm attack.
PW4 and PW5 who had come to the scene of the offence on their motor-
cycle could not possibly have removed the deceased on a two-wheeler to
the hospital and hence it was DW4- Parveen who took him in the car
belonging to the deceased;
(ii) Corroboration of the presence of PW4 and PW5 at the scene of offence is
established by the fact that the track suit of the deceased was handed over
by PW5 to the police. One of the articles that has been examined in the
course of the third FSL report is the track suit of the deceased. This would
indicate the presence of PW4 and PW5;
(iii) PW4 and PW5 were cross-examined at length on their presence at the
scene of occurrence. Their testimony is corroborated by the medical
evidence which suggests that the death occurred due to extensive fire arm
injuries;
17(iv) As regards the FSL reports, the test cartridges were fired from pistol W/2
and the test firing was carried out in the lab. The test cartridges and test
bullets were again compared. However, the third FSL report inadvertently
mentions that pistol W/2 was recovered from Rajesh though it was actually
recovered from Ajay;
(v) Though the third FSL report does not refer to pistol W/1 which was
recovered from Rajesh, his conviction can be sustained under the
provisions of Section 34 of the IPC having regard to the extensive nature
of the fire arm injuries and the recovery of fire arms;
(vi) Both the appellants refused the test identification parade and an adverse
inference ought to be drawn. The explanation of the appellants that they
did so because their photographs were published in the newspapers is
belied by the fact that out of the three newspaper publications, only one
had mentioned their names and none of them had published their
photographs;
(vii) The FSL reports were filed by the defence after the statements of the
appellants under Section 313 of the CrPC were recorded, and the failure to
examine the ballistics examiner must be construed from that perspective;
(viii) The eye-witness account of PW4 and PW5 finds corroboration in the
medical evidence and the FSL report; and
(ix) Though the appellants have sought to discredit the prosecution version by
adverting to the blackening of the injury, blackening is not always due to
18the close range of the firing, as noticed in the judgment of this Court in
9
Mohan Singh vs. State of M.P.
12 The rival submissions will now be considered. Broadly speaking the
submissions in the present case traverse three areas:
(i) Whether PWs 4 and 5 were eye-witnesses at the scene of occurrence on
26 December 2006;
(ii) The weight to be ascribed to the third FSL report; and
(iii) The refusal of the accused appellants to undergo a test identification
parade.
13 Each of the above aspects needs to be analyzed.
The presence of PW4-Azad Singh and PW5-Sunil Singh
14 PW4 is the complainant, the father of the deceased. PW5-Sunil is the
brother of the deceased. The FIR records that the information was received at the
Police Station Sadar, Rohtak at 5:20 pm on 26 December 2006. General diary
reference entry 22/2012 is at 6:20 pm. The FIR which was registered on the
statement of PW4 states that the son-in-law of the complainant had come to visit
and wanted to meet the deceased Sandeep. Since Sandeep was not reachable
at his cell phone, PW4 and PW5 are stated to have gone to the University and
when they arrived near the law department they noticed “six boys under the tin
sheds”, who started firing at Sandeep. The incident is stated to have taken place
9 (1999) 2 SCC 428
19at 2:30 pm and following the gun shots which were fired at him, Sandeep is
stated to have fallen on the ground. According to the FIR, the accused escaped
from the spot. The complainant stated that he and his son Sunil could identify the
three young boys if they were brought before them. The FIR contains a specific
statement that Sandeep was removed to PGIMS, Rohtak by Parveen, son of Zile
Singh Hooda, a resident of Kailash Colony, Rohtak and by one other boy in a
Santro car which was standing at the spot.
15 The principal line of attack to doubt whether PW4 and PW5 are eye-
witnesses to the occurrence is based on the improvements made in the course of
their deposition. In the course of his examination-in-chief, PW4 stated that when
he and PW5 were at a distance of 100 feet from Sandeep, they saw “three boys
firing shots”. He purported to identify the three accused who were present in the
Court as the persons who had fired on his son “with weapons which were like
pistols and revolvers”. PW4 then stated that “we [meaning thereby PW4 and
PW5] took our son Sandeep in Santro car to the Casualty Department of PGIMS,
Rohtak as my son was having bullet injuries on his chest, thighs, arm and
temple”. PW4 states that Sandeep was declared as brought dead by the doctors
and then the police reached the hospital and recorded his statement, marked as
Exhibit PB. During the course of the cross-examination, PW4 denied that at the
time of occurrence, Sikandar Rathi (DW5) and ‘Lehri’ (potentially referring to
DW4) were standing with his son. In the course of the cross-examination, it was
suggested to PW4 that Sandeep was not removed by him and PW5 to the
hospital and that as a matter of fact, it was Sikandar Rathi (DW5) and
20‘Lehri’(DW4) who had taken him to the hospital. PW4 denied this suggestion as
well as the suggestion that neither he nor PW5 were present at the scene of
occurrence. PW4 also stated that the clothes worn by him and by PW5 were
smeared with blood but they had not been collected by the police. According to
PW4, he and PW5 reached PGIMS, Rohtak at about 2.45pm and the police had
arrived at 4:00pm.
16 In the course of his examination-in-chief, PW5 similarly stated that
Sandeep had been removed to the hospital by him and his father PW4 and that
he gave the shirt of the track suit of Sandeep to the police, which was removed
by him while they were shifting him to hospital. PW5, in the course of his cross-
examination stated that when he and PW4 took Sandeep to hospital their clothes
were smeared with blood but that neither he nor PW4 handed over their clothes
to the police.
17 PW4, in the course of his cross-examination, stated that he, PW5 and “one
unknown person” had lifted Sandeep from the spot to take him to PGIMS,
Rohtak. On the other hand, PW5, in the course of his deposition, does not
mention the presence of any third person who took Sandeep with them to the
hospital. While PW4 states that the police reached the hospital at 4:00pm, PW5,
on the other hand, is unaware of when the police had reached the hospital. Now,
in this background, it is important to notice that there are clear improvements
made by PW4 and PW5, which have a bearing on whether they were eye-
witnesses to the alleged occurrence. Both PW4 and PW5 have made substantial
improvements in the course of their examination in evidence. Both the witnesses
21attempted to bolster the case of the prosecution with regard to their presence at
the scene of crime and of being eye-witnesses to the occurrence by stating that
they had removed Sandeep to the hospital after he had been gunned down. The
absence of any reference to their taking Sandeep to the hospital in the FIR has a
bearing on whether they were eye-witnesses to the occurrence. The incident took
place at the University where the deceased was a student and, according to
PW4, was preparing for his supplementary law exams. The theory that PW4 and
PW5 were present at the scene of offence and had removed the deceased to the
hospital must be tested with reference to two significant circumstances which
have emerged from the record. First, the record of the trial before the Sessions
Court, which has been produced before this Court, indicates that the deceased
was brought dead to PGIMS, Rohtak at 3:00pm. The ruqqa was sent to the police
at 3:35pm. The ruqqa indicates that the deceased was brought by “Sandeep
Lehri son of Shri Zile Singh Hooda, Resident of Kailash Colony, Rohtak”. The
reference to ‘Sandeep Lehri’ is a significant circumstance which indicates that
neither PW4 nor PW5 were present at the scene of offence which is why, after
the incident, it was not PW4 or PW5, but a third person who had transported the
deceased Sandeep to the hospital. The Sessions Court while appreciating this
aspect, explained away the argument of the defence that neither PW4 nor PW5
were present at the scene of offence, by holding that perhaps both of them were
present, but had suffered a shock of having witnessed the murder of Sandeep
which is why the ruqqa was signed by DW4. In arriving at this conclusion, the
Sessions Court had supplied an explanation which does not comport with the
case of the prosecution. Second, the case of the prosecution, it must be noted,
22was not that Sandeep was taken to the hospital by two other persons who
eventually were produced by the defence in evidence as DW4 (Parveen) and
DW5 (Sikandar Rathi). The case of the prosecution was that as a matter of fact
PW4 and PW5 had taken Sandeep to PGIMS, Rohtak. As we have noted earlier,
PW4 stated that he, PW5 and an unknown person had done so, while PW5
stated it was only PW4 and him who had removed the injured to hospital. The
defence produced, among other witnesses, DW4 and DW5. In the course of his
examination, DW4 stated that he and DW5 had taken Sandeep to the hospital
and that PW4 and PW5 had arrived at the hospital after they reached there. DW4
stated that he and DW5 removed Sandeep to PGIMS, Rohtak and it was about
10 to 15 minutes after their arrival at the hospital that PW4 and other relatives
reached the hospital. Though the ruqqa mentioned the name of the person who
brought the deceased to PGIMS as Sandeep Lehri, son of Zile Singh Hooda,
resident of Kailash Colony Rohtak, the name of the person is evidently incorrect
since it is Parveen (DW4) who is the son of Zile Singh Hooda and resident of
Kailash Colony, Rohtak. DW4 and DW5 stated that it was them who had taken
Sandeep to the hospital and neither PW4 nor PW5 were present at the scene of
the occurrence.
18 Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent sought to submit
that the presence of PW5 at the scene of occurrence is corroborated by the fact
that the shirt of the track suit of the deceased was handed over by PW5 to the
police and it had been examined in the third FSL report. The handing over of the
track suit of the deceased Sandeep to the police at the hospital by PW5 would
indicate his presence at PGIMS, Rohtak but does not establish that PW4 or PW5
23were eye-witnesses to the incident which took place near the law department at
the University. As a matter of fact, DW5 in the course of his examination stated
that he and DW4 had informed the father and brother of the deceased and that
the police had also recorded their statements. The presence of DW4 is a
reasonable inference which emerges from the ruqqa. For reasons best known to
the prosecution, neither DW4 (Parveen) nor DW5 (Sikandar) were produced as
witnesses and the failure of the prosecution to lead the evidence of DW4
(Parveen) is a matter which has a bearing on the issue as to whether PW4 and
PW5 were genuine eye-witnesses at the scene of occurrence. The material and
evidence which has emerged on the record is sufficient to cast doubt on their
presence at the scene of occurrence. Additionally, the Sessions Court did not
deal with the depositions of DW4 and DW5, save and except for stating that their
deposition on the age of the assailants being around 30-35 years, did not inspire
confidence. The discussion in the judgment of the Sessions Court on this crucial
aspect lacks proper evaluation of the evidence at hand.
19 In this background, it is necessary to notice that according to the FIR which
was lodged on a complaint by PW4, there was a previous enmity/quarrel between
the deceased and the accused. PW4, in the course of his cross-examination
stated that the deceased was facing trial in 2-3 cases, in some of which he had
been acquitted. However, PW4 expressed ignorance about whether the
deceased was a co-accused with accused Rajesh alias Sarkari. Moreover, he
stated that he did not know the accused Rajesh on account of his being co-
accused with Sandeep in a case bearing FIR No. 341 dated 23 June 2001 under
Sections 454/380 of the IPC at Police Station, Civil Lines, Rohtak or whether they
24were arrested in the case. He denied the suggestion that Sandeep and Rajesh
appeared together in the case and that PW4 had visited the court on each and
every date of hearing of that case, in spite of PW4 being a surety in that case for
the deceased Sandeep. Contrary to what was stated in the FIR, PW4 in course of
his cross examination stated that the deceased had no previous enmity with any
of the accused before the occurrence. PW5, in the course of his cross-
examination, was confronted with the fact that the deceased had been facing trial
in criminal cases and specifically admitted that the deceased was facing criminal
trial in 2-3 matters, where he was acquitted on account of a compromise. PW5
also stated that he was unaware as to whether Sandeep was a co-accused
together with Rajesh in a case bearing FIR No. 341 under Sections 454 and 380
of the IPC. However, he stated:
“It is correct to suggest that I and my father used to come to
the court when my brother Sandeep alias Bhander and
present accused Rajesh alias Sarkari were being produced in
the court on various dates of hearings. I do not know as to
who had the engaged the counsel for my brother in that case
and who stood surety for him”.
20 The fact that the deceased was facing trial in other cases was also stated
in the course of DW4’s examination-in-chief. This aspect of the case would be of
particular relevance to determine whether an adverse inference should be drawn,
as the State has suggested, to the refusal of the appellants to submit themselves
to a test identification parade. This aspect will be dealt with in a subsequent part
of the judgment.
25FSL Reports
21 Now while considering this aspect of the record, it must be noticed that the
weapons which are alleged to have been used by the two appellants in the
course of the crime were, according the prosecution, seized in connection with
another FIR No. 311 under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC and
Sections 25, 54, 59 of the Arms Act, registered on 19 May 2006 at Police Station
Civil Lines, Rohtak, against both the appellants. There are two FSL reports
pertaining to FIR No. 311:
1) The first FSL report dated 12 March 2007 pertains to three parcels
containing:
(i) clothes of the one injured Kuldeep in that case; and
(ii) One 7.65mm fired bullet stated to have been taken from the body of
the injured marked BC/1; and four 7.65mm fired pistol cartridges
cases and one 7.65 live pistol cartridges collected at the place of
occurrence (marked C/1 to C/4 and L/1).
The first FSL report is to the following effect:
“ LABORATORY EXAMINATION
The class as well as individual characteristic marks present
on 7.65mm fired cartridge cases marked C/1 to C/4 were
examined and inter-compared under stereo and comparison
microscope. 7.65mm fired bullet marked BC/1 was also
examined under stereo microscope.
The holes on the clothes contained in parcel No. 1 were
examined for firearm discharge residues. Lead was detected
from the margins of the holes on T-shirts and paints. The
margins of the holes on the T-shirt and paints contained in
parcel No. 1 were also examined under stereo microscope.
Based on the examination carried out in the laboratory, the
result of analysis is as under:
RESULT
261. 7.65mm fired cartridge cases marked C/1 to C/4 have
been fired from the one and same fire arm.
2. 7.65mm fired bullet marked BC/1 has been fired from
a Country made firearm.
3. Holes on the T-shirt and the paints contained in parcel
No. 1 have been caused by bullet projectiles.
4. Report in original from Serology division is enclosed
herewith.
Note: After examination exhibits examined in the Ballistics
division were resealed along with the original
wrappers with the seals of L.S.Y. (BALL) FSL (H).”
The FSL report has been prepared by LS Yadav, Senior Scientific Officer
(Ballistics) at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Karnal.
2) The second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 (described as a part
report in connection with FIR No. 311) deals with 4 parcels containing:
(i) one pistol chambered for 7.65mm cartridges along with a magazine
bearing No. 7111, one 7.65mm fired cartridge case and one 7.65mm
live cartridge stated to have been recovered from accused Rajesh. The
pistol was marked W/1 and the cartridge case C/5;
(ii) one pistol chambered for 7.62mm/0.30” cartridges and magazine and
one 7.62mm misfired cartridge stated to have been recovered from
accused Ajay. The pistol was marked W/2 and the misfired cartridge
MC/1;
(iii) one 7.65mm fired bullet (already market BC/1 in FSL No. F-06/2193)
referred to in the first FSL report; and
(iv) four 7.65mm fired cartridge cases and one 7.65mm live cartridge (the
fired cartridges marked C/1 to C/4 in the first FSL report).
27The second FSL report contains the following:
“LABORATORY EXAMINATION
Products of combustion of smokeless powder were detected
from the barrels of pistols marked W/1 (chambered for
7.65mm cartridges), w/2 (Chambered for 7.62mm/.30."
cartridges). Test firings were done in the laboratory from
pistols marked W/1 & W/2. Their firing mechanism were found
in working order.
The class as well as individual characteristic marks present
on 7.65mm fired cartridge cases C/1 to C/5, 7.62mm/.30"
misfired cartridge marked MC/1, 7.65mm fired bullet BC/1
and those on test fired cartridge cases and bullets fired from
pistols marked W/1 (chambered for 7.65mm cartridges), W/2
(chambered for 7.62mm/30" cartridges) were examined and
compared with their respective caliber/bore under stereo and
comparison microscope.
Based on the examination carried out in the laboratory, the
result of analysis Is as under.
RESULT
1. Pistols marked W/1 (chambered for ·7.65mm
cartridges), W/2 (chambered for 7.62mm/.30"
cartridges) are firearms as defined in the Arms Act 54
of 1959. Their firing mechanism were found in working
order. Pistols W/1 & W/2 had been fired through.
2. 7.65mm fired cartridge case marked C/5 has been
fired from pistol marked W/1 (chambered for 7.65mm
cartridges) and not from any other firearm even of the
same make and bore/calibre, because every firearm
has got its own individual characteristic marks.
3. 7.62mm misfired cartridge marked MC/1 has missed-
fire from pistol marked W/2 (chambered for
7.62mm/.30" cartridges)
4. 7.65mm fired cartridge cases marked C/1 to C/4 and
7.65mm fired bullet BC/1 have not been fired from
pistol marked W/1 (chambered for 7.65mm cartridges)
Note :- i) After examination, exhibits were resealed alongwith
their original wrappers with the seal of L.S.Y, SSO
(BALL) FSL.(H).
ii) One number of 7.65mm live cartridge received in
parcel No. IV has been used in test firings in the
laboratory.”
28The second FSL report has also been prepared again by LS Yadav, Senior
Scientific Officer (Ballistic) at the FSL, Madhuban Karnal.
3) The third FSL report dated 29 November 2007 in the present case is
marked as Exhibit PD. The third FSL report is with reference to a
forwarding memo of the Deputy Superintendent of Police (HO Rohtak)
dated 31 December 2006 regarding five sealed parcels in connection with
FIR No. 781 dated 26 December 2006 under Section 302 read with 34 of
the IPC and Sections 25, 54 and 55 of the Arms Act at Police Station Civil
Lines, Rohtak. The forwarding memo is stated to have been received by
the FSL on 8 January 2007. The FSL report contains a description of five
articles in the parcels as follows:
(i) blood stained earth lifted from the place of occurrence;
(ii) seven 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridge cases and one 7.62mm
mauser pistol fired bullet stated to have been recovered from the place
of occurrence. The cartridge cases marked as C/1 to C/3 and the bullet
BC/1;
(iii) blood-stained cloth recovered from the car by the witness and blood-
stained clothes of the deceased; and
(iv) two 7.62mm deformed and mutilated fired bullets, two lead pieces
stated to have been recovered from the body of the deceased (the
bullets are BC/2, BC/3, and the lead pieces are BC/4 and BC/5).
29The third FSL report contains the following:
“LABORATORY EXAMINATION
The class as well as the individual characteristic marks
present on 7.62mm mauser pistol fired cartridge cases
marked C/1 to C/7 and 7.62mm mauser pistol fired bullets
marked BC/1 to BC/3 and those on test carriages and test
bullets fired from country made pistol marked W/2
(chambered for 7.62mm cartridges) [Received in case FSL

25/54/59 A.Act P.S Civil Line Rohtak recovered on 25.06.07)
were examined and compared under stereo and comparison
microscope.
The clothes contained in parcel No. III & IV were examined
for the presence of gunshot discharge residues. Copper and
lead in traces were detected from the margins of the holes on
the clothes contained in parcels No III & IV. The holes on the
clothes were also examined under stereo microscope.
The lead pieces marked BC/4 & BC/5 contained in parcel No.
V were examined. Lead piece marked BC/4 was found to be
a 455” revolved bullet. No regular rifling marks were observed
on BC/4 when examined under stereomicroscope.
Based on the examination carried out in the laboratory, the
result of analysis is as under:
RESULT
1. The 7.62mm fired cartridge cases marked C/1 to C/7 and
7.62 mm fired bullets marked BC/1 to BC/3 have been fired a
country made pistol marked W/2 chambered for 7.62mm
cartridges) [Received in case FSL No. 07/F-3937 FIR No. 311

not from any other firearm even of same make and bore,
because every firearm has got its own individual
characteristics marks.
2. The holes on the clothes contained in parcel No. III & IV have
been caused by bullet projectiles.
3. The lead piece marked BC/5 contained in parcel No. V could
form part of core of a bullet.
4. The lead piece marked BC/4 was found to be deformed and
mutilated .455” revolver bullet. No regular rifling marks were
observed on BC/4.
5. Report in original from Serology division is enclosed herewith.
Note:- i) Exhibits examined in the Ballistics Division were
resealed alongwith their original wrappers with the seal of
A.D.(BALL)/ FSL (H).”
30The third FSL report has been prepared by RK Koshal, Assistant Director
(Ballistics) at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Karnal.
22 In evaluating the third FSL report, three crucial aspects need to be flagged
at this stage: first, the FSL report contains a comparison and analysis of what is
described in the result as a “country made pistol marked W/2 chambered for
7.62mm cartridges”; second, the FSL report contains no reference to the pistol
which was marked as W/1 in the second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 in
reference to FIR No. 311 and third, the above extract under the result section
indicates that pistol W/2 (which is the only pistol analysed) was recovered from
Rajesh alias Sarkari in the course of the investigation in FIR No. 311. The above
aspects have a crucial bearing on the weight to be ascribed to the third FSL
report.
23 The three aspects which have been highlighted above demonstrate that,
out of the alleged two recoveries of the pistols which were marked as W/1 and
W/2 in the course of the investigation into FIR No. 311, only one of the two
pistols, namely W/2, has been analysed with reference to the cartridges and fired
bullets stated to have been recovered from the scene of offence in the present
case. Pistol W/1, as the second FSL report dated 25 September 2007 in relation
to FIR No. 311 indicates, was alleged by the prosecution to have been recovered
at the behest of accused Rajesh while pistol W/2 was allegedly recovered from
accused Ajay. The third FSL report in the present case contains a ballistics
analysis of only one of the two pistols namely W/2 and not W/1. Moreover, the
third FSL report contains an erroneous statement that W/2 was recovered at the
31behest of Rajesh when, as we have seen, W/2 is a recovery which the
prosecution alleges to have been made from accused Ajay in the course of the
investigation in the FIR No. 311. Pistol W/1 was, in other words, clearly not made
available to the examiner for the purpose of a ballistic examination.
24 Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants also
highlights the following discrepancies:
(i) While the recoveries which were made at site are described as 7.62/25mm
cartridges, the FSL report in the context of FIR No. 311 contains a
reference to 7.62/30mm cartridges;
(ii) What was test fired for the purposes of the ballistic examination in FIR
No.311 were the 7.62/30mm bullets; and
(iii) While the third FSL report dated 29 November 2007 in the present case
refers to mauser pistol fired bullets, the conclusion is at variance in that it
refers to a country made pistol.
25 The submission of the appellants is that the weapon which was seized in
the context of the earlier investigation was not made available to the examiner in
the present case at all. This submission was sought to be refuted by reason of
the fact that a test firing of weapon W/2 did take place.
26 Now in this background an important facet of the matter which requires to
be noticed was that neither the author of the first and second FSL reports in the
context of the seizure and recovery of weapons W/1 and W/2 in FIR No. 311; nor
the author of the third FSL report in the context of FIR No.781 (the FIR in the
32present case) have been examined by the prosecution in the course of the
evidence.
27 The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State sought to explain
the failure of the prosecution to examine the ballistics examiners in evidence by
submitting that the FSL reports were, as a matter of fact, filed by the defence
after the statements of the appellants under Section 313 of the CrPC were
recorded. This submission was, in particular, urged in response to the grievance
of the appellants that in the statements under Section 313, only Exhibits PD and
PF were drawn to the attention of the accused. Learned Counsel for the State
urged that since the FSL reports have been produced by the defence, the failure
of the prosecution to examine the ballistics examiner stands explained.
28 In this context, it would now be necessary to advert briefly to the legal
10
position. In Mohinder Singh vs State (“Mohinder Singh”), a three judge
Bench of this Court observed:
“12. In a case where death is due to injuries or wounds
caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been
considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by
expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for
the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with
which and in the manner in which they are alleged to
have been caused. It is elementary that where the
prosecution has a definite or positive case, it must prove
the whole of that case. In the present case, it is doubtful
whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant
were caused by a gun or by a rifle. Indeed, it seems more
likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun, and yet
the case for the prosecution is that the appellant was armed
with a gun and, in his examination, it was definitely put to him
that he was armed with the gun P-16. It is only by the
10 AIR 1953 SC 415
33evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have
been ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the
appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such
evidence alone could settle the controversy as to
whether they could possibly have been caused by a
firearm being used at such a close range as is suggested
in the evidence. It is clear, and it is also the prosecution
case, that only 2 shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one
of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove
was that these shots were fired by two persons and not
by one man, and both the shots were fired in such
manner and from such distance as is alleged by the
eyewitnesses.”
(emphasis supplied)
29 The decision in Mohinder Singh was considered by a co-ordinate Bench
of this Court also consisting of three judges in Gurucharan Singh vs State of
11
Punjab (“Gurucharan Singh”). In Gurucharan Singh, the Court noted that in
the earlier decision, the case of the prosecution was that the accused had shot
the deceased with a gun but it appeared likely that the injury on the deceased
had been inflicted by a rifle and there was no evidence of a duly qualified expert
to prove that the injuries had been caused by a gun. Moreover, the nature of the
injuries was such that the shots must have been fired by more than one person
and there was no evidence to show that another person had also engaged in the
shooting. The oral evidence was not of disinterested witnesses. Hence, it was
held that in that backdrop, the failure to examine an expert was a serious infirmity
in the prosecution case. Explaining the facts as they emerged in the earlier
decision in Mohinder Singh, the three judge Bench in Gurucharan Singh held:
11 (1963) 3 SCR 585
34“41. […] It would be noticed that these observations were
made in a case where the prosecution evidence suffered from
serious infirmities and in determining the effect of these
observations, it would not be fair or reasonable to forget the
facts in respect of which they came to be made. These
observations do not purport to lay down an inflexible Rule that
in every case where an accused person is charged with
murder caused by a lethal weapon, the prosecution case can
succeed in proving the charge only if an expert is examined. It
is possible to imagine cases where the direct evidence is of
such an unimpeachable character and the nature of the
injuries disclosed by post-mortem notes is so clearly
consistent with the direct evidence that the examination of a
ballistic expert may not be regarded as essential. Where the
direct evidence is not satisfactory or disinterested or where
the injuries are alleged to have been caused with a gun and
they prima facie appear to have been inflicted by a rifle,
undoubtedly the apparent inconsistency can be cured or the
oral evidence can be corroborated by leading the evidence of
a ballistic expert. In what cases the examination of a ballistic
expert is essential for the proof of the prosecution case, must
naturally depend upon the circumstances of each case.
Therefore, we do not think that Mr Purushottam is right in
contending as a general proposition that in every case where
a firearm is alleged to have been used by an accused person,
in addition to the direct evidence, prosecution must lead the
evidence of a ballistic expert, however good the direct
evidence may be and though on the record there may be no
reason to doubt the said direct evidence.”
Hence, in Gurucharan Singh, this Court held that there is no inflexible rule to the
effect that the prosecution could succeed in proving the charge of murder alleged
to have been caused with a lethal weapon only if an expert is examined. Where
the direct evidence is of an unimpeachable character and the nature of the
injuries disclosed by the post-mortem reports is clearly consistent with the direct
evidence, the examination of a ballistics expert may not be essential. Contrarily,
the evidence of a ballistics expert would assume significance where direct
evidence is not satisfactory, or is of interested witnesses or where the nature of
the injuries requires expert corroboration. In other words, whether the
35examination of a ballistics expert is necessary is dependent upon the factual
context as it emerges in each case.
12
30 In Sukhwant Singh vs State of Punjab (“Sukhwant Singh”), a two
judge Bench of this Court held that the omission of the investigating officer to
send a recovered empty and sealed pistol to the ballistics expert for examination
was a significant omission. In that context, the bench observed:
“21. […] It hardly needs to be emphasised that in cases
where injuries are caused by firearms, the opinion of the
ballistic expert is of a considerable importance where both the
firearm and the crime cartridge are recovered during the
investigation to connect an accused with the crime. Failure to
produce the expert opinion before the trial court in such cases
affects the creditworthiness of the prosecution case to a great
extent.”
13
31 In State of Punjab vs Jugraj Singh (“Jugraj Singh”), a two judge
Bench of this Court distinguished the decision in Sukhwant Singh and noted that
in that case the evidence of two eye-witnesses was held to be inadmissible since
they were not examined in terms of Section 138 of the Evidence Act and the
court did not rely on the sole testimony of PW3. Hence, the failure to produce an
expert opinion was held to have affected the credit worthiness of the prosecution
case. In Jugraj Singh, the Court held that: “nowhere it was held [in Sukhwant
Singh] that on account of failure to produce the expert opinion the prosecution
version in all cases should be disbelieved”. Accordingly, in Jugraj Singh, the
Court noted:
12 (1995) 3 SCC 367
13 (2002) 3 SCC 234
36“18. In the instant case the investigating officer has
categorically stated that guns seized were not in a
working condition and he, in his discretion, found that no
purpose would be served by sending the same to the
ballistic expert for his opinion. No further question was put
to the investigating officer in cross-examination to find out
whether despite the guns being defective the fire pin was
in order or not. In the presence of convincing evidence of
two eyewitnesses and other attending circumstances we
do not find that the non-examination of the expert in this
case has, in any way, affected the creditworthiness of the
version put forth by the eyewitnesses.”

32 In Vineet Kumar Chauhan vs State of UP , a two judge Bench of this
Court has held:
“11. It cannot be laid down as a general proposition that in
every case where a firearm is allegedly used by an accused
person, the prosecution must lead the evidence of a ballistic
expert to prove the charge, irrespective of the quality of the
direct evidence available on record. It needs little emphasis
that where direct evidence is of such an unimpeachable
character, and the nature of injuries, disclosed by the post-
mortem notes is consistent with the direct evidence, the
examination of ballistic expert may not be regarded as
essential. However, where direct evidence is not available or
that there is some doubt as to whether the injuries could or
could not have been caused by a particular weapon,
examination of an expert would be desirable to cure an
apparent inconsistency or for the purpose of corroboration of
oral evidence.”

33 In Govindaraju vs State , a two judge Bench of this Court drew an
adverse inference where no person from the FSL had been examined. In drawing
this conclusion, the Court referred to the non-production of material witnesses
like the doctor, who performed the post-mortem and examined the victims, and
14 (2007) 14 SCC 660
15 (2012) 4 SCC 722
37the head constable and constable, who reached the site upon occurrence. Since
the other witnesses produced by the prosecution had also turned hostile, the
Court drew an adverse inference against the prosecution for not examining these
material witnesses. The Court noted:
“63. There is certainly some content in the submissions made
before us that non-production of material witnesses like the
doctor, who performed the post-mortem and examined the
victim before he was declared dead as well as of the Head
Constable and the constable who reached the site
immediately upon the occurrence and the other two witnesses
turning hostile, creates a reasonable doubt in the case of the
prosecution and the court should also draw adverse inference
against the prosecution for not examining the material
witnesses. We have already dwelled upon appreciation of
evidence at some length in the facts and circumstances of the
present case. There is deficiency in the case of the
prosecution as it should have proved its case beyond
reasonable doubt with the help of these witnesses, which it
chose not to produce before the court, despite their
availability.
[…]
66. This Court in Takhaji Hiraji [(2001) 6 SCC 145 : 2001
SCC (Cri) 1070] clearly stated that material witness is one
who would unfold the genesis of the incident or an essential
part of the prosecution case and by examining such
witnesses the gaps or infirmities in the case of the
prosecution could be supplied. If such a witness, without
justification, is not examined, inference against the
prosecution can be drawn by the court. The fact that the
witnesses who were necessary to unfold the narrative of the
incident and though not examined, but were cited by the
prosecution, certainly raises a suspicion. When the principal
witnesses of the prosecution become hostile, greater is the
requirement of the prosecution to examine all other material
witnesses who could depose in completing the chain by
proven facts. This view was reiterated by this Court in Yakub
Ismailbhai Patel v. State of Gujarat [(2004) 12 SCC 229 :
2004 SCC (Cri) 196].”
34 The precedent which we have reviewed above would thus indicate that
there is no inflexible rule which requires the prosecution to examine a ballistics
38examiner in every case where a murder is alleged to have been caused with the
use of a fire arm. The decision in Mohinder Singh (1953) has since been
explained in Gurucharan Singh (1963) by a co-ordinate Bench. Thereafter, the
principle which has emerged from the line of authority which we have noticed
earlier, is that the failure of the prosecution in a given case, to examine a
ballistics expert has to be assessed bearing in mind the overall context of the
nature of the evidence which is available. When direct evidence of an
unimpeachable character is available and the nature of injuries is consistent with
the direct evidence, the examination of a ballistics expert need not be insisted
upon as a condition to the prosecution proving its case. On the other hand, where
direct evidence is not available or there is doubt in regard to the nature of that
evidence, the failure to examine the ballistic examiner would assume
significance. In the present case, the weapons of offence were alleged to have
been recovered in the context of the investigation in another FIR (FIR No.311
dated 19 May 2006). The weapons were marked as W/1 and W/2 in that case.
The third FSL report arising out of the investigation in FIR No. 781 in the present
case does not deal with weapon W/1 at all. Moreover, as we have noted earlier,
the third FSL report wrongly attributes weapon W/2 to accused Rajesh alias
Sarkari. Whether or not weapon W/2 had been made available to the ballistics
examiner was a matter which could have been explained if the prosecution were
to lead his evidence. The prosecution cited a ballistics examiner as a witness and
yet, did not lead his evidence. This must be juxtaposed in light of the fact that the
eye-witness account of PW4 and PW5 is not free from doubt. We have also
analysed the evidence of PW4 and PW5 and have noted that there is a grave
39element of doubt as to whether they were witnesses at the scene of occurrence.
In this context, the Court must therefore hold that the discrepancies which have
been noticed in the FSL report could have best been explained by the authors of
FSL reports both in FIR No. 311/2006 and FIR No. 781/2006. This not having
been done, the accused would, in our view, be entitled to the benefit of doubt.
35 The appellants have urged that PW4 was not an eye-witness as he had
deposed that Sandeep was fired at from a distance of 4-5 feet which is not
supported by the medical evidence. They urge that the blackening of a few
firearm injuries on the deceased’s body is conclusive proof that the firing must
16
have been done from a closer distance, which could be less than 2 feet. Since
the depositions of PW4 and PW5 suffer from several material contradictions and
improvements; and the non-examination of the ballistics expert in light of serious
controversies in the FSL reports has cast a shadow on the prosecution’s story,
we need not deal with the additional argument on blackening of injuries.

Refusal to undergo Test Identification Parade
36 The prosecution has submitted that an adverse inference should be drawn
against the appellants for refusing to submit themselves to a TIP. Before we deal
with the circumstances in which the appellants declined a TIP, it becomes
essential to scrutinize the precedent from this Court bearing on the subject. A line
of precedent of this Court has dwelt on the purpose of conducting a TIP, the
source of the authority of the investigator to do so, the manner in which these
16 Relies on (2016) 2 SCC 607
17 TIP
40proceedings should be conducted, the weight to be ascribed to identification in
the course of a TIP and the circumstances in which an adverse inference can be
drawn against the accused who refuses to undergo the process. The principles
which have emerged from the precedents of this Court can be summarized as
follows:
(i) The purpose of conducting a TIP is that persons who claim to have seen
the offender at the time of the occurrence identify them from amongst the
other individuals without tutoring or aid from any source. An identification
parade, in other words, tests the memory of the witnesses, in order for the
prosecution to determine whether any or all of them can be cited as eye-
witness to the crime;
(ii) There is no specific provision either in the CrPC or the Indian Evidence
18
Act, 1872 which lends statutory authority to an identification parade.
Identification parades belong to the stage of the investigation of crime and
there is no provision which compels the investigating agency to hold or
confers a right on the accused to claim a TIP;
(iii) Identification parades are governed in that context by the provision of
Section 162 of the CrPC;
18 Evidence Act
41(iv) A TIP should ordinarily be conducted soon after the arrest of the accused,
so as to preclude a possibility of the accused being shown to the witnesses
before it is held;
(v) The identification of the accused in court constitutes substantive evidence;
(vi) Facts which establish the identity of the accused person are treated to be
relevant under Section 9 of the Evidence Act;
(vii) A TIP may lend corroboration to the identification of the witness in court, if
so required;
(viii) As a rule of prudence, the court would, generally speaking, look for
corroboration of the witness’ identification of the accused in court, in the
form of earlier identification proceedings. The rule of prudence is subject to
the exception when the court considers it safe to rely upon the evidence of
a particular witness without such, or other corroboration;
(ix) Since a TIP does not constitute substantive evidence, the failure to hold it
does not ipso facto make the evidence of identification inadmissible;
(x) The weight that is attached to such identification is a matter to be
determined by the court in the circumstances of that particular case;
(xi) Identification of the accused in a TIP or in court is not essential in every
case where guilt is established on the basis of circumstances which lend
assurance to the nature and the quality of the evidence; and
42(xii) The court of fact may, in the context and circumstances of each case,
determine whether an adverse inference should be drawn against the
accused for refusing to participate in a TIP. However, the court would look
for corroborating material of a substantial nature before it enters a finding
in regard to the guilt of the accused.
37 These principles have evolved over a period of time and emanate from the
following decisions:
1. Matru v. State of U.P. [(1971) 2 SCC 75 : 1971 SCC
(Cri) 391]
2. Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain [(1973) 2 SCC 406
: 1973 SCC (Cri) 828]
3. Malkhansingh v. State of M.P. [(2003) 5 SCC 746 :
2003 SCC (Cri) 1247]
4. Visveswaran v. State [(2003) 6 SCC 73]
5. Munshi Singh Gautam v. State of M.P. [(2005) 9
SCC 631]
6. Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT
of Delhi) [(2010) 6 SCC 1],
7. Ashwani Kumar and Ors. v. State of Punjab (2015)
6 SCC 308.
8. Mukesh and Ors. v. State for NCT of Delhi and
Ors. AIR 2017 SC 2161.
38 In the backdrop of these principles, it would be necessary to scrutinize the
evidence in the present case. PW4 in the course of his cross examination stated
that the deceased had been facing trial in 2-3 cases and that he was a surety for
his son. He claimed to be ignorant of the fact that the deceased was a co-
accused with Rajesh alias Sarkari in a criminal case arising out of FIR No.
341/2001, under Sections 454 and 380 of the IPC at Police Station Civil Lines,
Rohtak, inspite of being the deceased’s surety in the same. Nor did he know
whether both of them had been arrested in the case arising out of FIR No. 341 on
4324 June 2001. Similarly, PW5, during the course of his cross-examination,
professed that he did not know whether the deceased was the co-accused with
Rajesh alias Sarkari in the case arising out of FIR No. 341. But immediately
thereafter a suggestion was put to him, which he accepted, that he and his father
(PW4) used to go to the court when his brother– the deceased Sandeep – and
the present accused Rajesh alias Sarkari were being produced in the court on
various dates of hearings. He denied the suggestion that PW4 would visit on
every date of hearing in court. When PW5 was questioned during the course of
cross- examination on whether he had seen the photographs of the accused
Rajesh in the newspapers, he said:
“I have never seen the photographs of accused Rajesh alias
Sarkari in the newspapers. The photos of this accused must
have been published in the newspapers so many times but I
have never seen his photographs in the newspaper. I hate the
face of Rajesh alias Sarkari and due to this reason, I did not
see his photograph in the newspaper’’.
39 Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State has sought to urge that
out of all the three publications which were proved in the course of the evidence,
only one contained the names of the accused. However, the central point in this
case is whether on the basis of significant aspects which have emerged during
the course of cross-examination of PW4 and PW5, an adverse inference should
be drawn against the appellants for having refused to undergo a TIP. The
evidence on the record indicates that not only did the deceased have several
criminal cases against him, some of which had ended in acquittal on account of a
compromise, but that one of the appellants, Rajesh alias Sarkari, and the
deceased were co-accused in a case arising out of FIR No. 341 dated 23 June
442001 under Sections 454 and 380 of the IPC at Police Station Civil Lines, Rohtak.
Evidently both of them had been arrested in connection with the case, which is
why PW5 deposed that his father PW4 used to go to court when Sandeep and
Rajesh were being produced on various dates of hearing. PW4 also stated that
he has stood surety for his son in various criminal cases. In this backdrop, the
contention of the appellants that the refusal to undergo a TIP is borne out by the
fact that Sandeep and Rajesh were known to each other prior to the occurrence
and that PW4, who is a prime eye-witness, had seen Rajesh when he would
attend the court during the course of the hearings, cannot be brushed aside.
Consequently, in a case, such as the present, the Court would be circumspect
about drawing an adverse inference from the facts, as they have emerged. In any
event, as we have noticed, the identification in the course of a TIP is intended to
lend assurance to the identity of the accused. The finding of guilt cannot be
based purely on the refusal of the accused to undergo an identification parade. In
the present case, we have already indicated the presence of the alleged eye-
witnesses PW4 and PW5 at the scene of the occurrence is seriously in doubt.
The ballistics evidence connecting the empty cartridges and the bullets recovered
from the body of the deceased with an alleged weapon of offence is contradictory
and suffers from serious infirmities. Hence, in this backdrop, a refusal to undergo
a TIP assumes secondary importance, if at all, and cannot survive independently
in the absence of it being a substantive piece of evidence.
40 For the above reasons, we have arrived at the conclusion that the
prosecution has failed to establish its case beyond reasonable doubt. The
appellants are, hence, entitled to the benefit of doubt and are acquitted of the
45offence with which they have been charged. The Court is apprised of the fact that
the appellants have undergone over 12 years of imprisonment. Consequent on
the present judgment acquitting the appellants, they shall be released and their
bail bonds be cancelled unless they are wanted in connection with any other
case. The appeal is allowed in the above terms.
41 Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
