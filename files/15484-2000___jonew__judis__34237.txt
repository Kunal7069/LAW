the order passed by the High Court, the present appeal has been
filed.
Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that while
convicting the appellant for offence punishable under Sections 302
and 307 IPC the High Court lost sight of the fact that the weapon
which was purportedly used was a small dharia (FAGA). The medical
evidence also does not make out a case for conviction in terms of
Section 302 IPC. Reference is made to the evidence of the Doctor
PW2 to contend that there was no definite opinion as to whether the
injury inflicted could have caused death in the ordinary course.
Learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand supported the
judgment of the High Court.
2. Considering the evidence, and taking note of the nature of the
injury that was inflicted, we are of the considered view that
appropriate conviction would be under Section 304 Part-(II) IPC. The
background facts show that there was pre-,meditation over exchange
of words, one injury leading to the death was inflicted. Though in all
cases the number of injuries is not the determinative factor for
attracting Section 302 IPC, in the instant case, considering the
nature of weapon used and surrounding factors, the conviction is
altered. The conviction of the High Court under Section 307 IPC does
not warrant any interference and is accordingly upheld. Coming to
the question of sentence , it needs to be noted that occurence took
place on 18.12.1989 that too over a matter concerning the refusal of
the deceased and the informant to the marriage proposal. He was
about 19 years of age at the relevant point of time. Considering the
peculiar facts of the case, we are of the view that the custodial
sentence of six years would meet the ends of justice. The appellant
was released pursuant to the order dated 10.05.2002. He shall
surrender to custody forthwith to serve remainder of sentence.
3. The appeal is disposed of accordingly.
