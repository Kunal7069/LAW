Bala, as a reason whereof, there was exchange of hot words amongst her husband, two
sons with the accused and his father. At that time, the accused Samir Kumar Mondal
stated to have brought a crowbar and stuck on the head on Ajit Kumar Mondal,
husband of PW2; as a consequence whereof, father of PW1 became unconscious and
sustained bleeding injuries. He was taken to the Primary Health Centre but later
shifted to Suri Sadar Hospital. He succumbed to the injuries. On the next date i.e on
25.01.2008 first information report was lodged at the police station. The prosecution
relied on the evidence of four persons who are stated to be eye-witnesses. The trial
court on the basis of evidence brought on record found the respondent Samir Kumar
Mondal to be guilty as noted above and convicted him. In appeal, the High Court
found that the evidence of the witness do not inspire confidence and not reliable,
genesis of the prosecution story was suppressed and therefore it was
unsafe to rely on the witnesses.
Learned counsel for the appellant and learned counsel for the State of West
Bengal submitted that the reasonings of the High Court are contrary to the evidence
and material on record. Learned counsel for the respondent supported the judgment
of the High Court.
We find that the High Court has analysed the evidence and has come to a
categorical conclusion that there

was discrepancy between the injuries and also of size of the injuries as stated by the
Doctor. The eye-witnesses were not reliable. The genesis of the prosecution version isdoubtful. The view taken by the High Court is a possible view and we do not consider
these appeals to be fit cases where any interference is called for.
The appeals are dismissed accordingly.
