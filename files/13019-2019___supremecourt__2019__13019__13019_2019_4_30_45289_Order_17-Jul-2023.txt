REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NOS. OF 2023
(Arising out of SLP(Crl.) No. 4212-4213 of 2019)
THE STATE OF GUJARAT ETC. Appellant(s)
VERSUS
CHOODAMANI PARMESHWARAN
IYER & ANR. ETC. Respondent(s)
O R D E R
1. Leave granted.
2. The learned counsel appearing for the private
respondents (Assessees) submitted that he is not in
a position to assist this Court as his clients are
not in touch with him past almost six months.
3. In view of the aforesaid, we had no benefit
of any assistance from the learned counsel
appearing for the private respondents.
4. We have heard Mr. Kanu Agrawal, the learned
counsel appearing for the State of Gujarat.
5. It appears from the materials on record that
a summons came to be issued dated 31.10.2018 to the
respondents under Section 145 of the Central Excise2
Act, 1944 (for short ”the Act 1944”) as made
applicable to the service tax vide Section 83 of
the Finance Act, 1994 and Section 70 of the Central
Goods and Service Tax Act, 2017 (for short “the
CGST Act 2017”) calling upon them to remain present
for the purpose of interrogation in connection with
an inquiry against one M/s. Iyer Enterprise Mundra
Kutch. The authority concerned wants to interrogate
the respondents in regard to the alleged evasion of
Goods and Service Tax Liability/Contravention of
the Provision of the Finance Act 1994 and CGST Act
2017.
6. Upon receipt of the summons, the respondents
apprehended arrest at the end of the concerned
officials of the Department.
7. In such circumstances as referred to above,
two writ applications came to be filed before the
High Court being Special Criminal Application Nos.
11010 of 2018 and 11076 of 2018 resply. Both the
writ applications came to be disposed by a common
order dated 24.12.2018. The relevant part of the
impugned order reads thus:-3
“7. Considering the voluntary nature of
pleadings where the petitioners are desirous
of getting themselves assisted by the
adjudicatory process, let them represent
their case before the concerned authority.
The authority concerned shall complete the
same in 8 weeks’ time and if there is a need
for any apprehension after once the
adjudicatory process is completed, if they
are not ready to fulfill their obligation,
they may be given an opportunity of two more
weeks for taking necessary steps. Petitioners
shall appear on or before 11/01/2019 before
the concerned Police Station.
In view of the above, the present
applications stand disposed of. Direct
service is permitted.”
8. The State of Gujarat being dissatisfied with the
aforesaid order passed by the High Court is here before
this Court with the present appeal.
9. For the first time, this Court took up the matter
on 29.04.2019 and issued notice. While issuing notice,
this Court granted relief staying the directions issued
by the High Court that the adjudicatory process must be
completed within a period of eight weeks.
10. The learned counsel appearing for the State of
Gujarat pointed out that as many as 14 summons have
been issued to one of the respondents. Only once, one
of the respondents appeared for the purpose of
interrogation. Thereafter, none of the respondents4
appeared before the authority. It’s been now 5 years
that the inquiry is still pending. He further submitted
that it is only after the respondents are interrogated,
that the department will be able to ascertain whether
there is any evasion or not and on the basis of which
the future course of action like filing of complaint
etc., would be decided.
11. We are not convinced with the manner in which the
High Court has disposed of both the writ applications
filed by the respondents. It was expected of the
respondents to honour the summons and appear before the
authority for the purpose of interrogation.
12. It is well-settled position of law that power to
arrest a person by an empowered authority under the GST
Act and could be termed as statutory in character and
ordinarily the writ court should not interfere with
exercise of such power. We say so because such power of
arrest can be exercised only in those cases where the
Commissioner or his delegatee has reasons to believe
that the person has committed any offence specified in
Clause (a) or Clause (b) or Clause(c) or Clause (d) of
sub-Section (1) of Section 132 which is punishable
under clause (i) or (ii) or sub-section (1) or sub-5
Section (2) of the said Section.
13. As observed by this Court in Union of India Vs.
Padam Narain Aggarwal and Ors. (2008) 13 SCC 305,
(which was in context with the powers of Custom
Officers to arrest under the Customs Act) such
statutory powers must be exercised on objective facts
of commission of an offence enumerated and the officer
concerned must have reason to believe that a person
sought to be arrested has been guilty of such an
offence.
14. This Court in Padam Narain Aggarwal (supra) made
it very clear that ordinarily the Court should not
impose any condition before effecting arrest. If any
conditions are imposed before effecting arrest for
instance giving prior intimation to the person
concerned etc., the statutory provisions would be
rendered ineffective, nugatory and meaningless.
15. What is important are the observations made in
paragraphs 44 and 45 resply of the decision of this
Court in the case of Padam Narain Aggarwal (supra),
which read thus:-
“44. In the case on hand, the respondents
were only summoned under Section 108 of the
Act for recording of their statements. The6
High Court was conscious and mindful of that
fact. It, therefore, held that the
applications for anticipatory bail, in the
circumstances, were premature. They were,
accordingly, disposed of by directing the
respondents to appear before the Customs
Authorities. The Court, however, did not stop
there. It stated that even if the Customs
Authorities find any non-bailable offence
against the applicants (the respondents
herein), they shall not be arrested without
ten days’ prior notice to them.
45. In our judgment, on the facts and in
the circumstances of the present case,
neither of the above directions can be said
to be legal, valid or in consonance with law.
Firstly, the order passed by the High Court
is a blanket one as held by the Constitution
Bench of this Court in Gurbaksh Singh and
seeks to grant protection to the respondents
in respect of any non-bailable offence.
Secondly, it illegally obstructs, interferes
and curtails the authority of the Customs
Officers from exercising statutory power of
arrest of a person said to have committed a
non-bailable offence by imposing a condition
of giving ten days’ prior notice, a condition
not warranted by law. The order passed by the
High Court to the extent of directions issued
to the Customs Authorities is, therefore,
liable to be set aside and is hereby set
aside.” (Emphasis supplied)
16. Thus, the position of law is that if any person
is summoned under Section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017 for
the purpose of recording of his statement, the
provisions of Section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code,
1908 cannot be invoked. We say so as no First
Information Report gets registered before the power of7
arrest under Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 is
invoked and in such circumstances, the person summoned
cannot invoke Section 438 of the Code of Criminal
Procedure for anticipatory bail. The only way a person
summoned can seek protection against the pre-trial
arrest is to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court
under Article 226 of the Constitution of India.
Undoubtedly, this is exactly what the respondents did
in the present case. What the respondents sought by
filing two criminal applications under Article 226 of
the Constitution before the High Court was the
direction to the appellant herein not to arrest them
in exercise of the power conferred by Section 69(1) of
the GST Act, 2017. This, in essence, is key to prayer
for anticipatory bail. However, as we have explained
aforesaid, at the stage of summons, the person
summoned cannot invoke Section 438 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure.
17. This Court in Kartar Singh Vs. State of Punjab,
(1994) 3 SCC 569, has, in no uncertain terms, observed
that a claim for pre-arrest protection is neither a
statutory right nor a right guaranteed under Articles
14, 19 and 21 resply of the Constitution of India.8
Although the Constitution Bench of this Court held
that there is no bar for the High Court to entertain
an application for pre-arrest protection under Article
226 of the Constitution of India, yet it was held that
such power should be exercised sparingly. There is a
fundamental distinction between a petition for
anticipatory bail and the writ of mandamus directing
an officer not to effect arrest. A writ of mandamus
would lie only to compel the performance of the
statutory or other duties. No writ of mandamus would
lie to prevent an officer from performing his
statutory function. When a writ application is filed
before the High Court under Article 226 of the
Constitution, the writ court owes a duty to examine
the fact of the case and ascertain whether the case of
the writ applicant falls under the category of
exceptional cases as indicated in Kartar Singh
(supra). The writ court should also ensure whether by
issuing the writ of mandamus, it would be preventing
the competent authority or proper officer from
performing any of their statutory functions.
18. In the aforesaid context, we may refer to a
Division Bench decision of the High Court of Telangana9
which ultimately came to be affirmed by this Court in
the Special Leave Petition (Crl.) No. 4430 of 2019
order dated 27.05.2019. We are referring to a decision
in the case of P.V. Ramana Reddy Vs. Union of India
Writ Petition Nos. 4764 of 2019 and allied petitions
decided on 18th April, 2019. There are few important
observations made by the High Court and we are in
complete agreement with the said observations. The
observations of the High Court fell in the context of
certain incongruities noticed in Section 69(1) and
Section 132 resply of the CGST Act, 2017. We quote the
relevant observations hereunder:-
“34. If CGST Act, 2017 is a complete code in
itself in respect of (1) the acts that
constitute offences, (2) the procedure
for prosecution and (3) the punishment upon
conviction, then the power of Commissioner,
who is not a Police Officer, to order the
arrest of a person should also emanate from
prescription contained in the Act itself.
Section 69(1) of CGST Act, 2017 very clearly
delineates the power of the Commissioner to
order the arrest of a person whom he has
reasons to believe, to have committed an
offence which is cognizable and non-bailable.
Therefore, we do not know how a person whom
the Commissioner believes to have committed
an offence specified in clauses (f) to (l) of
sub-Section (1) of Section 132 of CGST Act,
which are non-cognizable and bailable, could
be arrested at all, since Section 69(1) of
the CGST Act, 2017 does not confer power of
arrest in such cases.10
35. The fact that the power of arrest under
Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 is
confined only to cognizable and non-bailable
offences, is also fortified by sub-Section
(2) of Section 69 which obliges the Officer,
who carries out the arrest to inform the
arrested person of the grounds of arrest and
to produce him before a Magistrate within 24
hours. The duty enjoined upon the Officer
carrying out the arrest, to inform the
arrested person of the grounds of arrest and
to produce him before a Magistrate within 24
hours, is co-relatable under sub-Section (2)
of Section 69 of the CGST Act, 2017 to
Section 132(5) of the CGST Act, 2017 that
deals only with cognizable and non-bailable
offences.
36. But, interestingly, clauses (a) and (b)
of sub-Section (3) of Section 69 of the CGST
Act, 2017 deal in entirety only with cases of
persons arrested for the offences which are
indicated as non-cognizable and bailable. The
phrase “subject to the provisions of the Code
of Criminal Procedure” is used only in sub-
Section (3), which deals in entirety only
with the procedure to be followed after the
arrest of a person who is believed to have
committed a non-cognizable and bailable
offence. While clause (a) of sub-Section (3)
gives two options to the Officer carrying out
the arrest, namely, to grant bail by himself
or to forward the arrested person to the
custody of the Magistrate, clause (b) confers
the powers of an Officer incharge of a police
station, upon the Deputy Commissioner or the
Assistant Commissioner (GST), for the purpose
of releasing an arrested person on bail, in
the case of non-cognizable and bailable
offences.
37. In other words, even though Section 69(1)
of the CGST Act, 2017 does not confer any
power upon the Commissioner to order the11
arrest of a person, who has committed an
offence which is non-cognizable and bailable,
sub-Section (3) of Section 69 of the CGST
Act, 2017 deals with the grant of bail,
remand to custody and the procedure for grant
of bail to a person accused of the commission
of non-cognizable and bailable
offences. Thus, there is some incongruity
between sub-Sections (1) and (3) of Section
69 read with section 132 of the CGST Act,
2017.
38. Another difficulty with Section 69 of the
CGST Act, 2017 is that sub-Sections (1) and
(2) of Section 69 which deal with the power
of arrest and production before the
Magistrate in the case of cognizable and non-
bailable offences, do not use the phrase
“subject to the provisions of Cr.P.C.” This
phrase is used only in sub-Section (3) of
Section 69 in relation to the arrest and
grant of bail for offences which are non-
cognizable and bailable, though no power of
arrest is expressly conferred in relation to
non-cognizable and bailable offences.
39. It is important to note that under sub-
Section (4) of Section 132 of the CGST Act,
2017, all offences under the Act except those
under clauses (a) to (d) of Section 132 (1),
are made non-cognizable and bailable, not-
withstanding anything contained in Cr.P.C. In
addition, Section 67(10) of the CGST Act,
2017 makes the provisions of Cr.P.C. relating
to search and seizure, apply to searches and
seizures under this Act, subject to the modi-
fication that the word “Commissioner” shall
substitute the word “Magistrate” appearing in
Section 165 (5) of Cr.P.C., in its applica-
tion to CGST Act, 2017.
40. Therefore, (1) in the light of the fact
that Section 69(1) of the CGST Act, 2017 au-
thorizes the arrest only of persons who are12
believed to have committed cognizable and
non-bailable offences, but Section 69(3) of
the CGST Act, 2017 deals with the grant of
bail and the procedure for grant of bail even
to persons who are arrested in connection
with non-cognizable and bailable offences and
(2) in the light of the fact that the Commis-
sioner of GST is conferred with the powers of
search and seizure under Section 67(10) of
the CGST Act, 2017, in the same manner as
provided in Section 165 of the Cr.P.C., 1973,
the contention of the Additional Solicitor
General that the petitioners cannot take um-
brage under Sections41 and 41A of Cr.P.C. may
not be correct.
41. Though for the purpose of summoning of
witnesses and for summoning the production of
documents, the Proper Officer holding the en-
quiry under the CGST Act, 2017 is treated
like a Civil Court, there are four other
places in the Act, where a reference is made,
directly or indirectly, to the Cr.P.C. They
are (1) the reference to Cr.P.C. in relation
to search and seizure under Section 67(10) of
CGST Act, 2017, (2) the reference to Cr.P.C.
under sub-Section (3) of Section 69 in rela-
tion to the grant of bail for a person ar-
rested in connection to a non-cognizable and
bailable offence, (3) the reference to
Cr.P.C. in Section 132 (4) while making all
offences under the CGST Act, 2017 except
those specified in clauses (a) to (d) of Sec-
tion 132 (1) of CGST Act, 2017 as non-cogniz-
able and bailable and (4) the reference to
Sections 193 and 228 of IPC in Section 70(2)
of the CGST Act, 2017. Therefore, the con-
tention of learned Additional Solicitor Gen-
eral that in view of Section 69(3) of the
CGST Act, 2017, the petitioners cannot fall
back upon the limited protection against ar-13
rest, found in Sections 41 and 41A of
Cr.P.C., may not be correct. As pointed out
earlier, Section 41-A was inserted in Cr.P.C.
by Section 6 of the Code of Criminal Proce-
dure (Amendment) Act, 2008. Under sub-Section
(3) of Section 41A Cr.P.C., a person who com-
plies with a notice for appearance and who
continues to comply with the notice for ap-
pearance before the Summoning Officer, shall
not be arrested. In fact, the duty imposed
upon a Police Officer under Section 41A(1)
Cr.P.C., to summon a person for enquiry in
relation to a cognizable offence, is what is
substantially ingrained in Section 70(1) of
the CGST Act. Though Section 69(1) which con-
fers powers upon the Commissioner to order
the arrest of a person does not contain the
safeguards that are incorporated in Section
41 and 41A of Cr.P.C., we think Section 70(1)
of the CGST Act takes care of the contin-
gency.
42. In any case, the moment the Commissioner
has reasons to believe that a person has com-
mitted a cognizable and non-bailable offence
warranting his arrest, then we think that the
safeguards before arresting a person, as pro-
vided in Sections 41 and 41A of Cr.P.C., may
have to be kept in mind.
43. But, it may be remembered that Section
41A(3) of Cr.P.C., does not provide an abso-
lute irrevocable guarantee against arrest.
Despite the compliance with the notices of
appearance, a Police Officer himself is enti-
tled under Section 41A(3) Cr.P.C., for rea-
sons to be recorded, arrest a person. At this
stage, we may notice the difference in lan-
guage between Section 41A(3) of Cr.P.C. and
69(1) of CGST Act, 2017. Under Section 41A(3)
of Cr.P.C., “reasons are to be recorded”,14
once the Police Officer is of the opinion
that the persons concerned ought to be ar-
rested. In contrast, Section 69(1) uses the
phrase “reasons to believe”. There is a vast
difference between “reasons to be recorded”
and “reasons to believe.”
19. We are still inclined to give one more
opportunity to both the respondents to appear before
the authorities for the purpose of recording of their
statements. If the respondents fail to appear, then it
shall be open for the authority concerned to proceed
further in accordance with law.
20. In view of the aforesaid, both the appeals stand
allowed. The common order dated 24.12.2018 passed by
the High Court is set aside.
21. Pending application(s), if any, stand(s) disposed
of.
