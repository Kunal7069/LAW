NON-REPORTABLE
IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
CRIMINAL APPELATE JURISDICTION
CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1211 OF 2014
MUNAWWAR ….. APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
STATE OF UTTAR PRADESH ….. RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
SANJIV KHANNA, J.
The sole appellant, Munawwar, in this appeal assails his
conviction for murder and kidnapping of a seven-year old boy, ‘X’
under Sections 302 and 365 read with Section 34 of the Indian
Penal Code, 1860 (for short, ‘IPC’) as also causing disappearance
of evidence of offence under Section 201 read with Section 34
IPC. The appellant stands sentenced to undergo imprisonment
for life, seven years and three years rigorous imprisonment
respectively, which sentences, it is directed, shall run concurrently
(no separate sentence for fine has been imposed but we are not
commenting and examining this aspect in the present appeal and
judgment).
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 1 of 92. Learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the principle
of last seen has been wrongly invoked, for even if the Court were
to accept the testimony of Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2), Ashraf (PW-3),
Sayeed Ahmed (PW-5), and Mustak (PW-7), ‘X’ was last seen in
the company of the appellant, along with the appellant’s brothers
Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased) and a third person
Shamim, at Laddawala, Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh on April 01,
1988, whereas two ransom notes were purportedly received by
Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1), father of ‘X’, on April 03, 1988 and April
07, 1988, and subsequently, ‘X’s dead body was exhumed at a
different location on April 18, 1988. Reference was made to
Jaswant Gir vs. State of Punjab1 and State of Goa vs. Sanjay
Thakran & Another2. The appellant also submitted that there was
a delay in recording the First Information Report (FIR) under
Section 365 IPC, which, it was highlighted, was registered at
Police Station, Kotwali, Muzaffarnagar on April 07, 1988 at about
9:40 p.m.
3. We have considered the contentions but do not find any good
ground and reason to differ and upset concurrent finding of
conviction as recorded by the Additional District and Sessions
1 (2005) 12 SCC 438
2 (2007) 3 SCC 755
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 2 of 9Judge vide judgment dated August 19, 1992 and in the impugned
judgment of the Allahabad High Court dated March 08, 2013.
4. Co-accused and convicts Noor Mohammad and Shamim have not
filed an appeal before this Court and Tahir as noticed above has
since died. Hence, we are examining and deciding the present
appeal preferred by Munawwar.
5. The fact that ‘X’, son of Mohd. Khurshid who has appeared as
PW-1, was kidnapped on April 01, 1988 and his dead body was
exhumed on the basis of the disclosure statement made by Noor
Mohammad on April 18, 1988 has been proved and established
beyond debate and doubt. It is also an accepted position that the
appellant-Munawwar, Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased)
are brothers. Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1) in his deposition was lucid
that his seven-year old son, ‘X’, who had gone to a neighbourhood
shop on asking of his mother to purchase dal at about 4 p.m. on
April 01, 1988 did not return and was untraceable. PW-1, who
was working in the Tehsil, on return from work had searched and
looked desperately for ‘X’ but without success. Upon enquiring in
the neighbourhood, PW-1 had learnt that ‘X’ was last seen with
Noor Mohammad at the shop of Ashraf, as told to him by Ashraf
who had deposed as PW-3 and confirmed the fact. Mohd.
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 3 of 9Khurshid (PW-1) had also spoken to Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2), who
was standing a few feet away from the shop of Ashraf (PW-3), and
had seen ‘X’ with the appellant- Munawwar, Noor Mohammad,
Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim who had taken ‘X’ with them
on foot towards Sultan Industries. This narration was affirmed by
Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2), who had seen ‘X’ in the lap of Noor
Mohammad as they had moved out of the shop to the road where
the appellant-Munawwar, Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim
were present. Mohd. Sayeed (PW-2) had also testified that the
accused were maternal uncles of ‘X’ and they would daily take ‘X’
for a walk and get things for him to eat. Therefore, PW-2 had no
reason to suspect and did not deem it proper to intervene. PW-2
has confirmed his interaction with PW-1 in the evening when PW-
1 had made enquiries about his son.
6. We have the testimony of Mustak (PW-7), who has stated that he
knew ‘X’, son of Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1), who were residing in the
same mohalla. On April 01,1988 at about 5 p.m. PW-7 had
returned from Devband by bus. While proceeding towards
Laddawala, PW-7 had seen ‘X’ with the appellant- Munawwar,
Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim, who were
taking him towards the hill. He had not objected because he knew
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 4 of 9that the persons were relatives of ‘X’ and had thought that they
were possibly taking him for a walk.
7. Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1) has deposed that on April 03,1988 he had
received ransom letter (Ext. 1) for payment of Rs. 21,000/- for safe
release of ‘X’. Money was to be paid at the railway bridge.
Thereupon, PW-1 had proceeded to the house of the appellant
Munawwar and his brothers and had met Tahir (since deceased)
and had informed him about the ransom note and enquired if he
could tell him his son’s whereabouts. Tahir (since deceased) had
thereupon asked PW-1 to arrange for the money and to write a
letter seeking 2-3 days’ time to make payment. Several other
persons, including Kallu, were present with PW-1 at that time. On
the request of Tahir (since deceased), PW-1 had written a letter
and gave it to Tahir (since deceased) asking for 2-3 days’ time to
arrange for money. The aforesaid factum has been proved and
also testified by Sayeed Ahmad (PW-5) who was present with PW-
1 when the latter had spoken to Tahir (since deceased) about ‘X’
and the ransom note, and wrote the letter requesting for extension
of time to make the payment. On April 05, 1988, Tahir (since
deceased) had informed PW-1 that the letter had reached the
persons and they had given PW-1 time to arrange money.
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 5 of 98. Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1) has also testified about the second
ransom letter (Ext. 2) for payment of Rs. 22,000/- which was
thrown in his house by Shamim, one of the accused, an act which
was seen by Islam (PW-4) and Sayeed Ahmad (PW-5) who had
tried to apprehend and catch Shamim but were unsuccessful as
Shamim had managed to run away. Islam (PW-4) had also
testified that ‘X’ was missing and this fact was known to the entire
neighbourhood.
9. After receipt of the second ransom note, Mohd. Khurshid (PW-1)
had proceeded to lodge the police report/complaint vide Exhibit
KA-1. PW-1 had testified that upon submitting the scribed report,
the police report was made and read out to him, and having
understood the contents, he had put his signatures. Explaining the
reason for the delay in filing the FIR, PW-1 had elucidated that he
was arranging the money and perceiving danger and threat to the
life of ‘X’, he did not initially lodge a police report. Further, till the
second ransom note was thrown by one of the accused Shamim,
PW-1 was uncertain on whether or not Tahir (since deceased) was
trying to mislead him and also on participation and involvement of
the appellant and his brothers. PW-1 has also spoken about his
relation with the accused Shamim. Khalil who was uncle of his
wife was the brother-in-law of the accused Shamim, a fact stated
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 6 of 9by PW-1 in the cross-examination but not controverted or put for
denial.
10. Equally important is the evidence of recovery of the dead body of
‘X’ pursuant to the disclosure statement made by Noor
Mohammad upon his arrest on April 18, 1988. Noor Mohammad
had thereupon taken the police and PW-1 and others to Bajheri
jungle and the tube well of Irshad @ Yaseen and had shown the
place where the dead body of ‘X’, his clothes and the knife by
which he was killed had been buried in a ditch. Thereupon, after
digging earth, the dead body of ‘X’ was exhumed, and his clothes
and the knife were recovered vide Memo, Exhibit KA-2. PW-1 had
identified the dead body of his son ‘X’ by looking at his face.
Recovery of dead body of ‘X’ at the instance of Noor Mohammad
is a fact also affirmed by Mustak (PW-7) and Police Sub-Inspector
Raj Kishor Singh (PW-11).
11. The present case would not in a strict sense be a case of mere
‘last seen’. ‘X’ was kidnapped at about 4:00 p.m. on April 01,
1988 when he was seen in the custody of the present appellant,
Noor Mohammad, Tahir (since deceased) and Shamim near the
shop of Ashraf (PW-3). ‘X’ was a young boy, seven years in age,
who was close to and friendly with the appellant-Munawwar, his
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 7 of 9brothers namely Noor Mohammad and Tahir (since deceased) and
also knew Shamim who was living in the neighbourhood. The
factum that ‘X’ was kidnapped on April 01, 1988 at about 4:00 –
4:30 p.m. has been established and proved beyond doubt. The
identity of the kidnappers which includes the present appellant has
also been established. Reliance placed on the two judgments
relating to the “last seen” principle vide Jaswant Gir vs. State of
Punjab (supra) and State of Goa vs. Sanjay Thakran & Another
(supra) would not support the submissions on behalf of the
appellant, for, in the present case, there is direct evidence in the
form of ocular testimonies, as discussed above, which establish
that the present appellant and others had kidnapped and had held
their captivity. Further, there was no time gap or interregnum
between ‘X’s disappearance and kidnapping; they were
simultaneous. Subsequent evidence, including the conduct of
Shamim, who had thrown the second ransom note, and Noor
Mohammad, who had given the disclosure statement leading to
recovery of the dead body, would implicate and establish the
charge and the case of the prosecution.
12. Hence, we do not find any merit in the present appeal and we
affirm the judgment of the High Court accepting the judgment of
the Additional Sessions Judge convicting the appellant-
Criminal Appeal No. 1211 of 2014 Page 8 of 9Munawwar under Sections 302, 365 and 201 read with Section 34
of the IPC. The appeal has no merit and is dismissed.
