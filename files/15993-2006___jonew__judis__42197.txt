STATE OF PUNJAB …. Appellant
Versus
LABH SINGH …. Respondent

Uday Umesh Lalit, J.
1. This appeal by special leave challenges the judgment and order dated
17.01.2006 passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Criminal
Revision No.1743 of 2005 whereby it set aside the order of the Special
Judge, Patiala dated 07.06.2005 framing charges against one Sikandar Singh
and the present respondent.
2. FIR No.57 was lodged with Police Station, Vigilance Bureau, Patiala
Range, Patiala on 13.08.1997. It was alleged that semi-Government letter
dated 04.03.1994 had stated that pursuant to certain raids conducted at the
site for checking the earth work done on Bhakra main line, it was found that
Page 12
as regards four projects cross sections/estimates were not prepared before
doing any work and that it appeared that the estimates were actually
prepared by the concerned Government servants after completion of work
thereby violating provisions of PWD code and causing loss to the tune of
Rs.3,69,603 to the exchequer. Pursuant to said FIR crime was registered and
investigation was undertaken by the Vigilance Bureau.
3. When request was made for grant of sanction to prosecute the
Government servants in question, it was refused by the department on
13.09.2000. Yet another attempt was made in the year 2003 requesting
sanction to prosecute but such request was again rejected by the department
on 24.09.2003. Despite such refusal for issuance of sanction, challan under
section 173 of Criminal Procedure Code was filed on 09.11.2004 in the court
of Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, Patiala. The allegations in the
challan dated 09.11.2004 were to the following effect:
“During the checking of the aforesaid works, it was
found that regarding the work done on the above
mentioned 4 works, cross sections/estimates etc. have not
been prepared, which is mandatory before doing any
work. From this, it appears that after completing the
work, this was done to prepare cross sections estimates
according to their own wish by the suspected officers.
Checking memo was prepared at the spot, upon which
signatures of concerned J.E and Sub Divisional Engineer
were obtained, who admitted that before doing the
aforesaid works, they did not prepare any cross section or
Page 23
estimates. From this, it is clearly established that the
suspected officer did not get prepared the cross sections
and estimates for embezzling the government treasury at
a large scale. In the aforesaid works, for
starting/finishing the repair works without preparing
estimates, the following officers are responsible.”
The challan so presented had arrayed two public servants namely Shri
Sikandar Singh, SDO and Shri Labh Singh, Junior Engineer in addition to
five private individuals. Shri Sikandar Singh and Shri Labh Singh had
retired on 13.12.1999 and 30.04.2000 respectively, i.e., even before the
request for issuance of sanction was rejected on the first occasion. The
aspect regarding their retirement and refusal to grant sanction was dealt with
in the challan in following terms:
“In view of the refusal of granting sanction for
prosecution by the department, it is impossible to present
challan against the employees who are in service, but the
employees who have retired, challan can be presented
against them in the court.”
4. The Special Judge framed charges on 07.06.2005 against all seven
accused for the offences under sections 218/409/465/467/120B IPC and
under section 13(1)(C) read with section 13(1)(2) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1988 (‘POC’ Act, for short). Out of six charges framed, one
pertained to the offence under section 13(1)(C) read with section 13(1)(2) of
Page 34
the POC Act while other five related to offences under the Indian Penal
Code.
5. The public servants namely Sikandar Singh and Labh Singh
challenged the aforesaid order dated 07.06.2005 by filing Criminal Revision
No.1743 of 2005 in the High Court of Punjab and Haryana. The High Court
took the view that the department had refused sanction to prosecute public
servants and yet a challan was presented on the premise that no sanction was
required after retirement of those public servants. The High Court observed;
“These petitioners and others have been charged for
offence under the Prevention of Corruption Act and also
for offences under the Indian Penal Code. Section 197
Cr.P.C. bars cognizance by the Court of an offence by a
public servant even after retirement. Even otherwise, it is
discriminatory for the petitioners when other co-accused
who are still in service, cannot be prosecuted for want of
sanction and present petitioners are being prosecuted
only because they have retired.”
The High Court allowed the petition and set aside the order dated
07.06.2005 passed by the Special Judge, Patiala.
6. This appeal by State of Punjab takes exception to the order of the
High Court. During the pendency of this appeal the first respondent
Sikandar Singh expired and his name was deleted from the array of parties
vide order dated 20.09.2010 passed by this Court, leaving Labh Singh as the
Page 45
only respondent before the Court. The stand taken in the petition of appeal
on behalf of the appellant is as under:
“It is humbly submitted that order passed by Hon’ble
High Court is erroneous in law as u/s 197 Cr.P.C.
respondents can be convicted and no previous sanction is
required as the respondents are no longer in service and
have been retired in the years 1999/2000. Secondly,
there was no discrimination as the other persons were in
service and since respondents have been retired no
previous sanction is required. It was also submitted that
other persons will also be prosecuted as and when they
are retired.”
Appearing for the State Mr. Sanchar Anand, learned advocate
submitted that sanction to prosecute was not required at all. Ms. Jaspreet
Gogia, learned advocate appearing for the respondent supported the view
taken by the High Court.
7. In the present case the public servants in question had retired on
13.12.1999 and 30.04.2000. The sanction to prosecute them was rejected
subsequent to their retirement i.e. first on 13.09.2000 and later on
24.09.2003. The public servants having retired from service there was no
occasion to consider grant of sanction under section 19 of the POC Act. The
law on the point is quite clear that sanction to prosecute the public servant
for the offences under the POC Act is not required if the public servant had
already retired on the date of cognizance by the court. In S.A.
Page 56
Venkataraman v. State1 while construing section 6(1) of the Prevention of
Corruption Act, 1947 which provision is in pari materia with section 19(1)
of the POC Act, this court held that no sanction was necessary in the case of
a person who had ceased to be the public servant at the time the court was
asked to take cognizance. The view taken in S. A. Venkataraman (supra)
was adopted by this court in C.R. Bansi v. State of Maharashtra2 and in
Kalicharan Mahapatra v. State of Orissa3 and by the Constitution Bench of
this court in K. Veeraswamy v. Union of India4. The High Court was not
therefore justified in setting aside the order passed by the Special Judge
insofar as charge under the POC Act was concerned.
8. However as regards charges for the offences punishable under the IPC
concerned the High Court was absolutely right in setting aside the order of
the Special Judge. Unlike section 19 of the POC Act, the protection under
section 197 of Cr.P.C. is available to the concerned public servant even after
retirement. Therefore, if the matter was considered by the sanctioning
authority and the sanction to prosecute was rejected first on 13.09.2000 and
secondly on 24.09.2003, the court could not have taken cognizance insofar
1 1958 SCR 1040
2 (1970) 3 SCC 537
3 (1998) 6 SCC 411
4 (1977) 3 SCC 440
Page 67
as the offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code are concerned. As
laid down by this Court in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Nishant Sareen5,
the recourse in such cases is either to challenge the order of the Sanctioning
Authority or to approach it again if there is any fresh material.
9. In the circumstances, in our view the order under appeal passed by the
High Court is correct insofar as charges under IPC are concerned but must
be set aside as regards charge under POC Act is concerned.
10. Before we part, we must record that we do not approve the stand taken
by the appellant in the petition. The prosecution cannot keep waiting till a
public servant retires and then choose to file charge-sheet against him after
his retirement, thereby setting at naught the protection available to him
under Section 19 of the POC Act. The appeal thus stands allowed partly.
No order as to costs.
