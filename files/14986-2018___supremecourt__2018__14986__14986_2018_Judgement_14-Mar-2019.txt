CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
CIVIL APPEAL NO(S). 3046/2019
(ARISING FROM SLP(C) NO(S). 4964/2019)
THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH & ORS. APPELLANT(S)
VERSUS
BUNTY RESPONDENT(S)
J U D G M E N T
1. Leave granted.
2. The State of Madhya Pradesh and Others are in appeal as
against the reversal of the judgment and order passed by the Single
Judge dismissing the writ application questioning the decision of
the Screening Committee holding the respondent/Bunty to be unfit
for appointment as a constable in the police service of the State
of Madhya Pradesh.
3. The respondent applied for the post of a Constable in the year
2013. He appeared and cleared the Police Constable Recruitment
Test (II). Physical endurance test was held on 06.05.2013. He
was medically examined and selected on 09.05.2014. On 05.06.2014
he was called for verification of the marks sheet, caste
1certificate. He was called for police verification by the
Screening Committee on 25.02.2015. On 11.03.2015, the department,
on the basis of the Report of the Screening Committee, decided to
deny the appointment to the respondent/Bunty for the reasons
mentioned therein.
4. It is not in dispute that respondent/Bunty was involved in a
case involving moral turpitude for the commission of an offence
under Sections 392 and 411 of the IPC. He was given benefit of
doubt in the said case and was acquitted vide judgment and order
dated 7.1.2015 and same has attained finality.
5. As against the denial of the appointment respondent/Bunty filed
a writ petition before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, Bench at
Indore. Learned Single Judge of the High Court considered the
matter in extensive detail and relied upon the decision of this
Court in Commissioner of Police, New Delhi and Another v. Mehar
Singh, (2013) 7 SCC 685, and that the petitioner had appeared
before the Screening Committee and it was found in objectivity by
the Screening Committee that he was involved in a case of moral
turpitude and the acquittal was not clean. He was found unfit for
being appointed as Police Constable in a disciplined force.
Reasons were communicated. Learned Single Judge also relied upon
the decision in State of M.P. and Others v. Dinesh Singh Parihar
and Others, rendered by the Division Bench of the High Court in
2Writ Appeal No.724/2014, dismissed the said writ application.
However, the Division Bench, by the impugned judgment and order,
has allowed the writ appeal preferred by the respondent/Bunty on
the ground that the judgment of acquittal is based on material on
record, he was acquitted since the offence was not proved beyond
reasonable doubt, appointment order has to be issued as a matter of
course. Hence, the appeal by special leave is filed before this
Court.
6. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the State has relied
upon the decisions of this Court in Mehar Singh (supra), State of
Madhya Pradesh & Ors. v. Parvez Khan, (2015) 2 SCC 591, Union
Territory, Chandigarh Administration and Others v. Pradeep Kumar
and Another, (2018) 1 SCC 797, to contend that when the Screening
Committee has formed an opinion with objectivity considered the
allegations and overall material the decision is not open to
judicial review until and unless it has acted arbitrarily or its
decision is perverse. Learned counsel further submitted that mere
acquittal on the ground of benefit of the doubt could not have
enured in favour of the appellant so as to be entitled to
appointment, as a matter of course as observed by the Division
Bench of the High Court.
7. On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the
respondent has relied on a decision of this Court in Avtar Singh v.
3Union of India and Others, (2016) 8 SCC 471, and Joginder Singh v.
Union Territory of Chandigarh and Others, (2015) 2 SCC 377.
Learned counsel appearing for the respondent has contended that it
was a case of no evidence and with respect to PW.12 also in the
representation filed before the Screening Committee with respect to
the said witness the reasons were assigned why he deposed against
the respondent. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of the case,
no case for interference is made out in the judgment and order
passed by the Division Bench. The respondent could not have been
termed to be unfit by the Screening Committee, in view of the
judgment of acquittal.
8. After hearing learned counsel for the parties, we are of the
opinion that the respondent had participated in the selection
process in the year 2013, at that time the said criminal case was
pending consideration and he has been acquitted subsequently, vide
judgment and order dated 7.1.2015 all throughout during selection
process the case was pending consideration and as certain witnesses
have turned hostile which is not unusual. The respondent knew very
well about the pendency of the case against him and it is not
uncommon to see that witnesses turned hostile. In the aforesaid
circumstance, it cannot be said to be case of clear acquittal, in
criminal case, he was given benefit of doubt not acquitted because
the case against him was found to be false. Thus, due to such
acquittal appointment could not have followed as a matter of course
4as observed by the Division Bench of the High Court.
9. Considering the nature of allegation in the case, it was a
case of impersonation as a police officer and thereby committing
the offence under Sections 392 and 411 of the IPC. It was a case
of the serious kind, which involved moral turpitude and having not
been granted the clean acquittal in the criminal case merely by the
grant of benefit of the doubt, clouds cannot be said to be clear as
to the antecedents of the respondent. Thus, the perception formed
by the Screening Committee that he was unfit to be inducted in the
disciplined police force was appropriate. In the aforesaid factual
matrix, decision of Scrutiny Committee could not be said to be such
which warranted judicial interference.
10. Learned Single Judge of the High Court in the factual matrix
projected, has rightly relied upon the decision in Mehar Singh
(supra), wherein this Court has observed as under:-
“35. The police force is a disciplined force. It
shoulders the great responsibility of maintaining
law and order and public order in society. People
repose great faith and confidence in it. It must
be worthy of that confidence. A candidate wishing
to join the police force must be a person of
utmost rectitude. He must have impeccable
character and integrity. A person having criminal
antecedents will not fit in this category. Even if
he is acquitted or discharged in the criminal
case, that acquittal or discharge order will have
to be examined to see whether he has been
completely exonerated in the case because even a
possibility of his taking to the life of crimes
poses a threat to the discipline of the police
force. The Standing Order, therefore, has
entrusted the task of taking decisions in these
5matters to the Screening Committee. The decision
of the Screening Committee must be taken as final
unless it is mala fide. In recent times, the image
of the police force is tarnished. Instances of
police personnel behaving in a wayward manner by
misusing power are in the public domain and are a
matter of concern. The reputation of the police
force has taken a beating. In such a situation, we
would not like to dilute the importance and
efficacy of a mechanism like the Screening
Committee created by the Delhi Police to ensure
that persons who are likely to erode its
credibility do not enter the police force. At the
same time, the Screening Committee must be alive
to the importance of the trust reposed in it and
must treat all candidates with an even hand."
11. That apart, when we consider the decision of the three-Judge
Bench of this Court in Avtar Singh (supra) the Court observed:-
“38.4.3 If acquittal had already been recorded in a
case involving moral turpitude or offence of
heinous/serious nature, on technical ground and it
is not a case of clean acquittal, or benefit of
reasonable doubt has been given, the employer may
consider all relevant facts available as to
antecedents, and may take appropriate decision as
to the continuance of the employee.”
12. In Pradeep Kumar (supra) this Court has observed:-
“15. From the above details, we find that the
Screening Committee examined each and every case
of the respondents and reasonings for their
acquittal and taken the decision. While deciding
whether a person involved in a criminal case has
been acquitted or discharged should be appointed
to a post in a police force, nature of offence in
which he is involved, whether it was an honourable
acquittal or only an extension of benefit of doubt
because of witnesses turned hostile and flaws in
the prosecution are all the aspects to be
considered by the Screening Committee for taking
6the decision whether the candidate is suitable for
the post. As pointed out earlier, the Screening
Committee examined each and every case and
reasonings for their acquittal and took the
decision that the respondents are not suitable for
the post of Constable in Chandigarh Police. The
procedure followed is as per Guideline 2(A)(b) an
object of such screening is to ensure that only
persons with impeccable character enter police
force. While so, the court cannot substitute its
views for the decision of the Screening
Committee."
13. The law laid down in the aforesaid decisions makes it clear
that in case acquittal in a criminal case is based on the benefit
of doubt or any other technical reason the employer can take into
consideration all relevant facts to take an appropriate decision as
to the fitness of an incumbent for appointment/continuance in
service. The decision taken by the Screening Committee in the
instant case could not have been faulted by the Division Bench.
14. Coming to the decision relied upon by the learned counsel
appearing for the respondent in Joginder Singh (supra) we are of
the opinion that it was not the case of the decision taken by the
Screening Committee on due consideration of the material on record
of the case. Thus, the decision is distinguishable. In the
peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, we are inclined to
hold that the decision of the Screening Committee was appropriate.
15. Thus, the judgment and order of the Division Bench cannot be
allowed to be sustained, the same is hereby set aside and the
7judgment and order passed by the Single Judge are restored. The
appeal is, accordingly, allowed. No orders as to costs.
Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of.
