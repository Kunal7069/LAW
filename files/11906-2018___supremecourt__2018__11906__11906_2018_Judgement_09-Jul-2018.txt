J U D G M E N T
KURIAN, J.
1. Leave granted.
2. The Appellant is before this Court, aggrieved by
the impugned order passed by the High Court, whereby
his prayer for intervention under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
has been declined.
3. Criminal proceedings have been initiated against
the Appellant under Section 406 read with Section 420
IPC. When the matter came up before this Court, we
directed the Appellant to deposit Rs. 1,50,000/-
(Rupees One Lakh and Fifty Thousand), which is little
more than the amount involved in the alleged
transaction. That amount has been deposited.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the de-facto
complainant submits that the amount may be directed
to be released to him. It is also submitted that
since he is getting his money, he has no intention to
proceed with the prosecution.2
5. The learned counsel appearing for the State
points out that the offences are compoundable with
permission of the court. In the above circumstances,
the appeal is disposed of with the following
directions :-
(a) The amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- (Rupees One Lakh and
Fifty Thousand) deposited by the Appellant shall be
released in favour of Respondent No. 4.
(b) The Appellant is permitted to move the trial
court for compounding the offence and Respondent No.4
shall cooperate in the process.
6. Taking note of the fact that the parties have
purchased peace, we direct the trial court to pass
appropriate orders in the interest of justice. All
the coercive steps taken against the appellant,
including freezing of the account, shall stand
withdrawn.
