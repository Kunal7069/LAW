VERSUS
STATE OF UTTARAKHAND & ANR. .....RESPONDENT(S)

HEMANT GUPTA, J.
1) The challenge in the present appeal is to an order passed by the
High Court of Uttarakhand at Nainital on April 3, 2019 whereby,
revision against an order of summoning of appellant under Section
319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 19731 remained
unsuccessful.
2) An FIR was lodged by Harpreet Singh, father of prosecutrix (aged
about 6 years), on April 19, 2017 at 1:23 p.m., about sexual assault
on her daughter. The FIR reads as under:
“My daughter xxxx who is 6 years old has been mentally
and physically harassed for 4-5 months in her school
Aurum the Global School Haldwani. My daughter was very
upset mentally for several days and would cry bitterly
when asked to go to School. On my asking several times,
she told me and my wife that in her School a teacher
touched her private parts deliberately. He would take her
1 for short, ‘Code’
1to the bathroom, close her eyes and then would insert a
stick like object in her vagina. This teacher had frightened
her and he had instigated her not to talk about this matter
to anyone. My daughter even told me that, whenever she
went to the bathroom, he would follow her, and molest her
there. Today, we showed the picture of this teacher to our
daughter by the medium of facebook, she recognized him,
and as a result we came to know that the name of this
teacher is Bablu Bisht. Sir, the owner of the School Ankit
Joshi, Principal Gauri Vohra and Class Teacher Nameeta
Joshi are equally guilty (at fault) in this case. It is there
pleaded of you, to kindly take stern action against the
culprits.”
3) After FIR was lodged, the statement of the victim was recorded by
the Investigating Officer under Section 161 of the Code on April 19,
2017. Some of the relevant extracts from the statement read as
under:
“When father enquired so I told my father about Bablu
Uncle’s incident, my mother was also there. Bablu Uncle
did these things earlier also – 3 days earlier he did the
same thing. Ever since, I came to class first, he has done
the same thing thrice.
Question: Do you recall any earlier instance when Bablu
Uncle or somebody from house or school did something
like this with you?
Answer: Aunty when I study in lkg and ukg then also
sometimes Bablu Uncle did these things with me, apart
from this nobody else has ever done anything with me.”
4) Later, another statement of the prosecutrix was recorded under
Section 161 of the Code on April 22, 2017 wherein, she stated that
after she returned from washroom, two Uncles came and picked
her away. In response to another question, the child responded
that these two persons work outside school. In respect of a
question whether she has seen these persons earlier, the answer
2was that they used to roam in the School. Relevant extract of the
statement read as under:
“On showing print photographs, which were taken from
school website by the parents of the kid, the girl said yes
to the photo of Bablu Bisht and pointed towards one more
photograph of another person. When we asked her
whether she has told to her madam about this incident,
she replied that she has told four times.”
5) It is thereafter, statement of the prosecutrix was recorded under
Section 164 of the Code on April 24, 2017 where she deposed, for
the first time, that after she returned to her classroom, two men
came; one of them wore spectacles and other did not. They took
her out from there. She deposed that two men had touched her
before also. She also deposed that she has told her parents about
the incident and that two persons assaulted her five times earlier
secretly in the garden. The appellant is said to be the person who
was wearing spectacles. On the basis of the evidence collected by
the investigating team, charge sheet was filed against Bablu Bisht
alias Balwant Singh. The prosecution has examined Harpreet
Singh, father of the prosecutrix as PW-1 who has deposed as under:
“When I asked her what had happened, she did not tell
anything. After I took her in confidence and asked her
what had happened, she asked me to promise that I would
not take her to the school and on this she told me that in
school one teacher uncle harassed her and touched her in
her private parts (place of urination) and inserts and
exerts a rod like object in my place of urination. Saying
this, the witness said that I had nothing left to console her.
I assured her that we would not be sending her to that
school now. After this, I and my family wept for a long
time. (stating the above matter, the witness wept in the
court as well).
3After this, my wife took my daughter to a separate
place, while I searched the profile of the male members of
the school. Four male members were found. I enlarged
these photos individually and showed it to my child; three
of these people she refused and when the photo of Bablu
Bisht was shown to her, she would not speak and become
silent (quite). When I asked her again, she again insisted
that she will not go to school, only then with fear she said
that he harassed her.
After this I did not speak further to my daughter on
this matter. I talked to her about other things to assure
her that we would not send her to that school. After this I
went to my brother Manpreet Singh’s house and told him
everything about the incident that had happened with
Harleen. Then I registered a complaint report about the
incident in Haldwani police station on 19.04.2017.
The witness on seeing the document no. 3A/2, a
printed complaint, said that this report was prepared by
me and I had submitted it in the police station after
putting my signatures on this. The witness endorsed his
signature on this document. This document was marked
as exhibit A-1. After this, keeping her security in
consideration we sent her to another school for her
studies.
The witness himself stated today that the invigilator
had asked him to bring the print out of the photographs
taken out from the face book. On this, we extracted the
picture of the teacher, owner and the principal, and
showed them to the child, she said that the man wearing
spectacles also held her hands and harassed her. The
man in spectacles was the owner of the school.”
6) The prosecutrix appeared as PW-2. The witness identified two
persons, one with spectacles when the photographs were shown to
her.
7) Supreet Kaur (PW-10), mother of the prosecutrix, stated that her
daughter told her that two persons troubled her, one of them was
wearing spectacles.
48) Gauri Vohra (PW-11) is the Principal of the School in which the
prosecutrix was the student. The extract from her statement
relevant for the present controversy reads as under:
“I called the Grievance cell members, which is comprised
of myself, Vice Principal Mrs. Ashu Pant and Priyanka. The
Victim’s family members asked us to call Balwant and
other staff members. When I asked Pandeyji about
Balwant then he replied that he was on leave that day.
After this, I informed Mani Sir, who is the Manager of our
School, about the entire incident over phone.
Just then, the victim’s father entered the office and started
shouting at us. Although I assured them that I would be
the first person to file a report against Balwant. In
response, the family members of the victim got furious
alleging that we had helped Balwant Singh to escape from
there and wanted to speak to Mani Sir.
I told them that Mani Sir was in Dehradun at that moment
and was returning back from there. Meanwhile several
people gathered in the School. Many of whom had come
to take their children back home. The family members of
the victim now started inciting these people. We
requested them to let the children go back home safely.
But the victim’s family started shouting that we won’t let
the children go back home. Very soon, Deepak Balutia
and Sumit Tikku came to the School. Soon after this, the
victim’s family members and the mob started breaking
and vandalizing the school property.”
9) The father of the prosecutrix filed an application to summon the
person who wears spectacles, as identified by the victim. Such
application was allowed by the learned Trial Court on February 20,
2019 which order was not interfered with by the High Court in a
revision petition.
10) Learned counsel for the appellant argued that the prosecutrix has
improved her statement time and again. The appellant is identified
5by the Spectacles from the photograph taken from the website of
the School or from the Facebook though the appellant is not a
member of the teaching faculty but part of the Management. The
FIR has been lodged after the details of occurrence have been
shared by the prosecutrix with her father. The allegations in the
first version are against only one person. In the first statement
recorded under Section 161 of the Code, again the allegations are
against one person. In fact, the prosecutrix has stated
categorically that except Bablu, nobody else has ever done
anything to her. In the second statement under Section 161 of the
Code, recorded after three days, the assailants became two and
that both work outside the School. She identifies the photo of
Bablu taken from the website of the School and points out one
photograph of another person. It is thereafter in her statement
under Section 164 of the Code recorded on April 24, 2017, the
other person is said to be wearing spectacles.
11) A Constitution Bench of this Court in Hardeep Singh v. State of
Punjab & Ors.2 while examining the scope of Section 319 of the
Code, held as under:
“100. However, there is a series of cases wherein this
Court while dealing with the provisions of Sections 227,
228, 239, 240, 241, 242 and 245 CrPC, has consistently
held that the court at the stage of framing of the charge
has to apply its mind to the question whether or not there
is any ground for presuming the commission of an offence
by the accused. The court has to see as to whether the
material brought on record reasonably connect the
accused with the offence. Nothing more is required to be
2 (2014) 3 SCC 92
6enquired into. While dealing with the aforesaid provisions,
the test of prima facie case is to be applied. The court has
to find out whether the materials offered by the
prosecution to be adduced as evidence are sufficient for
the court to proceed against the accused further. ………
xx xx xx
105. Power under Section 319 CrPC is a discretionary and
an extraordinary power. It is to be exercised sparingly and
only in those cases where the circumstances of the case
so warrant. It is not to be exercised because the
Magistrate or the Sessions Judge is of the opinion that
some other person may also be guilty of committing that
offence. Only where strong and cogent evidence occurs
against a person from the evidence led before the court
that such power should be exercised and not in a casual
and cavalier manner.
106. Thus, we hold that though only a prima facie case is
to be established from the evidence led before the court,
not necessarily tested on the anvil of cross-examination, it
requires much stronger evidence than mere probability of
his complicity. The test that has to be applied is one which
is more than prima facie case as exercised at the time of
framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an extent
that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to
conviction. In the absence of such satisfaction, the court
should refrain from exercising power under Section 319
CrPC. In Section 319 CrPC the purpose of providing if “it
appears from the evidence that any person not being the
accused has committed any offence” is clear from the
words “for which such person could be tried together with
the accused”. The words used are not “for which such
person could be convicted”. There is, therefore, no scope
for the court acting under Section 319 CrPC to form any
opinion as to the guilt of the accused.”
12) In Labhuji Amratji Thakor and Others v. State of Gujarat
and Others3, this Court held that the Court has to consider
substance of the evidence, which has come before it and has to
apply the test, i.e., “more than prima facie case as exercised at
3 AIR 2019 SC 734
7the time of framing of charge, but short of satisfaction to an
extent that the evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to
conviction. It was held as under:-
“The High Court does not even record any satisfaction that
the evidence on record as revealed by the statement of
victim and her mother even makes out a prima facie case
of offence against the appellants. The mere fact that Court
has power under Section 319 Cr.P.C. to proceed against
any person who is not named in the F.I.R. or in the Charge
Sheet does not mean that whenever in a statement
recorded before the Court, name of any person is taken,
the Court has to mechanically issue process under Section
319 Cr.P.C. The Court has to consider substance of the
evidence, which has come before it and as laid down by
the Constitution Bench in Hardeep Singh (supra) has to
apply the test, i.e., “more than prima facie case as
exercised at the time of framing of charge, but short of
satisfaction to an extent that the evidence, if goes
unrebutted, would lead to conviction.” Although, the High
Court has not adverted to test laid down by the
Constitution Bench nor has given any cogent reasons for
exercise of power under Section 319 Cr.P.C., but for our
satisfaction, we have looked into the evidence, which has
come on record before the trial court …………………The
observations of the trial court while rejecting the
application having that the application appears to be filed
with mala fide intention, has not even been adverted by
the High Court.”
13) Having heard the learned counsel for the parties at some length,
we find that the order summoning the appellant for the offences
under Section 376(2) of the Indian Penal Code, 18604 read with
Sections 5/6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
20125 is not sustainable in law.
4 for short, ‘IPC’
5 for short, ‘POCSO Act’
814) The prosecutrix is a small child. It is parents of the child who have
taken the photographs either from the website of the School or
from the Facebook to introduce a person with spectacles as an
accused. The initial version of the father of the prosecutrix and of
the prosecutrix herself, as disclosed by her father in the FIR, is
assault by one person. But in view of statement of Gauri Vohra (PW-
11), the anger was directed against the Management of the School
of which the appellant is a part. Even if the father of the child has
basis to be angry with the Management of the School but, we find
that no prima facie case of any active part on the part of the
appellant is made out in violating the small child. The involvement
of other persons on the statement of the child of impressionable
age does not inspire confidence that the appellant is liable to be
proceeded under Section 319 of the Code. In fact, it is suggestive
role of the family which influences the mind of the child to
indirectly implicate the appellant.
15) Obviously, the father of the child must have anger against the
Management of the School as his child was violated when she was
studying in the School managed by the appellant but, we find that
the anger of the father against the Management of the School
including the appellant is not sufficient to make him to stand trial
for the offences punishable under Section 376(2) of the IPC read
with Sections 5/6 of the POCSO Act.
916) The statement of the child so as to involve a person wearing
spectacles as an accused does not inspire confidence disclosing
more than prima facie to make him to stand trial of the offences.
Therefore, we hold that the order of summoning the appellant
under Section 319 of the Code is not legal. The fact, that the
prosecution after investigations has found no material to charge
the present appellant is also cannot be ignored. The heinous crime
committed should not be led into prosecuting a person only
because he was part of the Management of the School. We have
extracted the evidence led by the prosecution only to find out if
there is any prima facie case against the appellant. We are satisfied
that there is no prima facie case against the appellant, which
warrants his trial for the offences pending before the Court.
17) Consequently, the appeal is allowed. The order passed by the Trial
Court to summon the appellant under Section 319 of the Code is
set aside and the application is dismissed.
