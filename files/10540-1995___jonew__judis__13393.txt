The following Judgment of the Court was delivered:
NANAVATI, J.
We have heard learned counsel and also gone through the
evidence and the judgment of the High Court. We find that
the findings recorded by the High Court are correct. The
evidence of four witnesses, namely, Nathu, Dilawar, Jameelan
and Nanhey clearly establishes that Mahmood died as a result
of the shots fired by Ali Ahmad and Mahmod Sher and that
Jameelan and Nanhey received injuries as a result of the
shots fired by those two accused. The manner in which the
appellants had assaulted Nathu initially and chased him
right up to the house of Mahmood, their entering the house
of Mahmood and then firing shots at him and his wife and
child, when Mahmood had protested, clearly indicate that
both Ali Ahmad and Mahmod Sher had acted in concert and it
was in furtherance of their common intention that they had
caused death of Mahmood and bodily injuries to Jameelan and
Nanhey. The High Court was, therefore, right in convicting
Ali Ahmad and Mahmod Sher for the offences punishable under
Section 302 read with 34 IPC and Section 307 read with 34
IPC. The other three accused were rightly convicted under
Section 324 read with Section 149 IPC only.
This appeal is, therefore, dismissed.
The appellant Nos. 2-5 are on bail. Their bail bonds
are cancelled. They are directed to serve out the remaining
part of their sentence.
