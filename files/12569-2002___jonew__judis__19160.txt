Sema, J.
Five accused â\200\223 Chuttia, Gulab, Vrindavan, Brijrani and Jagat Singh â\200\223
were tried in Sessions Trial No. 72/85 by the IIIrd Additional Sessions

offences punishable under Sections 302/148 and 324 IPC and sentenced
them to undergo RI for life and RI for one year respectively. The sentences
were ordered to run concurrently. Accused â\200\223 Vrindavan chooses not to
prefer an appeal against his conviction. Accused â\200\223 Brijrani, who is the
appellant before us, is the mother of accused â\200\223 Vrindavan.
Briefly stated, the facts are as follows:
On 17.5.1985 when the deceased Rajaram was proceeding towards the
village (Hintoli-Bari) with a bucket to fetch milk, he stopped on the way and
had some talk with accused Chuttia. Then all of a sudden, he was assaulted
with Pabbal (Sabbal) from behind by accused Vrindavan, son of accused
Chuttia; and accused Brijrani, wife of Chuttia and mother of Vrindavan.
Deceased Rajaram tried to run away but the accused chased him. Accused
Vrindavan and accused Brijrani dealt farsa blows while other accused dealt
blows on him with their lathis. On being alarmed by the cries of Rajaram,
PW-4 â\200\223 Siyarani, who is the wife of deceased Rajaram, rushed to the spot to
rescue her husband but she also sustained a farsa blow on her head dealt by
the accused Vrindavan and sustained another farsa blow on her hand dealt
by accused Brijrani as a result of which she fell down. FIR (Ex. P1) was
lodged promptly at 9 AM on the same day in which all the particulars have
been mentioned. PW-17 â\200\223 V.K. Jain (I.O.) immediately reached the spot
and started investigating the case. After holding the inquest report (Ex.
P21), he seized the bucket and pair of shoes belonged to the deceased (Ex.
P11). He also seized samples of plain and blood stained earth and two
pieces of bone (Ex. P12). A blood stained farsa was seized from Brijrani
vide Ex. P16 on 17.5.1985. On 18.5.1985, a tabbal was seized from accused
Vrindavan. We are not mentioning the full particulars of the seized articles
from the possession of other accused as they are not before us, as noticed
above.
PW-12, Dr. V.P. Brijpuriya conducted postmortem examination on
the body of the deceased Raja Ram on 17.5.1985 and found following
eleven incised wounds of various dimensions.
"1. Cut wound â\200\223 13" x 3" x 2" on the left side of the back
starting from the tenth rib and going downwards. Sides of the
wound were clear and cut was vertical the upper. The upper
angle was acute and the lower angle was wider.
2. Cut wound in square shape â\200\223 11" x 7" x 5" on the back
(towards the chest) on the left side. The upper part of the
wound was extended upto skeptula and the lower part upto the
10th rib. It was 2" away from the middle line and was pointing
towards the inner side. On the outer side, it was upto the
shoulder. The sides of the wound was sharp and vertical.
Skeptula bone was cut into two parts. Lungs was protruding
and visible under the wound. Lungs had two cuts â\200\223 one 4" x 1Â½
and another was of 3" x 1". Chest was full of blood.
3. Cut wound: - 7" x 2" x 6" was on the right thigh â\200\223 in the

PW-12 found that the deceased â\200\223 Rajaram was virtually cut into two
and died on the spot as a result of excessive hemorrhage. The High Court,
on re-appreciation of evidence, convicted Brijrani and her son Vrindavan, as
noticed above.
It is not disputed that the deceased and the accused are closely related.
PW-4 â\200\223 Siyarani is the wife of deceased Rajaram. Accused Vrindavan is the
nephew of PW-4 â\200\223 Siyarani. Accused Brijrani is the elder sister-in-law
(Jethani) of PW-4. Accused Gulab is the nephew of PW-4. Accused Chuttia
is the brother-in-law of PW-4 and father of the accused Vrindavan. Accused
Brijrani is the mother of accused Vrindavan.
The High Court, while convicting the appellant, relied upon the
testimony of PW-1 â\200\223 Ghasiram and PW-4 â\200\223 Siyarani â\200\223 wife of the decea
sed.
PW-1 â\200\223 Ghasiram is an independent witness. He specifically stated in
earlier part of the statement that the incident was witnessed by him and both
accused Nos. 3 and 4 were armed with Pabbal and Farsa. This witness,
however, stated that he could not see later part of the assault near the house
of Dhanua as his view was obstructed by a house in between but he over-
heard Rajaram shouting for help. He has also stated that being alarmed by
the cry of her husband, Siyarani had rushed to his rescue. PW-4 â\200\223 Siyarani
has also stated that being alarmed by the cries of her husband, she went to
the house of Dhanua to rescue her husband. She saw her husband being
assaulted. She also suffered a farsa blow on her head dealt by accused
Vrindavan and another blow of farsa on her hand dealt by appellant â\200\223
Brijrani.
Mr. Manish Mohan, learned counsel for the appellant strongly urged
that the presence of the appellant â\200\223 Brijrani at the place of incidence has not
been established. This contention, in our view, is negatived by the testimony
of PWs. 1 and 4, apart from documentary and medical evidence. As already
noticed, accused and PW-4 were closely related. Blood stained farsa was
seized from the appellant â\200\223 Brijrani (Ex. P16) on the date of the incident, i.e.
17.5.1985 itself. PW-1 Ghasiram categorically stated that on the fateful
morning when he was going to the farm for daily morning routine, he saw
deceased Rajaram going from his house towards the village with a bucket
for taking milk. He also saw Rajaram stopped to talk to Chuttia. At that
time, accused Vrindavan hit Rajaram with Pabbal from behind which hit
Rajaram at his back. He also saw, amongst others, Gulab’s mother, which
witness was lateron identified as Brijrani, assaulting Rajaram with farsa.
PW-4 â\200\223 Siyarani is the wife of deceased Rajaram. She stated that
around 7 AM when she was inside the house, she heard the sound of her
husband "comeâ\200¦â\200¦save me" from the front side of the house of Vrindavan.
She rushed to Dhanua’s house where she saw her husband was being
assaulted. Accused Vrindavan came and gave a farsa blow on her head.
Appellant â\200\223 Brijrani gave a farsa blow on her arm and she fell down
unconsciously. When she regained consciousness she saw her husband was
cut into two pieces. She recognized the pabbal and farsa with which she was
hit. She could identify Pabbal (Art. A) with which she was hit by accused
Vrindavan and farsa (Art. B) with which she was hit by appellant â\200\223 Brijrani.
PWs. 1 and 4 were subjected to cross-examination but nothing could
be elicited to impeach the credit worthiness of their testimony.
PW. 12, Dr. H.P. Brijpuria, as already noticed, conducted post
mortem on the deceased and found eleven incised wounds of differenthttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 26 of 26
dimensions and sizes. The doctor opined that the sizes of all cut wounds
were clear and sharp. The doctor in paragraph 7 of his examination-in-chief,
stated as under:
"All the injuries of the deceased were ante-mortem. Wound
No. 1, 2, 3 and 6 were expected from sharp, heavy and long
edged weapon. Wound No. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 were expected
from a sharp cutting and heavy weapon which is different from
the earlier one. The inner injury of the wound No. 2 was
expected from multiple hit at the same spot. Injury No. 2 was
serious which was sufficient to cause death in normal
circumstances."
The doctor further opined in paragraph 20 of examination-in-chief as
under:
"The injuries suffered by the deceased is possible by the
weapons item (A) pharsa and Katarna item (B) produced in the
Court."
As already noticed, Art. (A) was seized from Vrindavan and Art. (B)
was seized from the appellant Brijrani. The doctor further opined that all the
injuries could not be possible by the same weapon because all of them were
of different depth and sizes. The doctor in paragraph 23 of cross-
examination stated as under:
"It is correct that the internal injuries suffer by the body depend
upon the fact that how the sharp edge of the weapon hits the
body. All the injuries could not be possible by the same
weapon because all of them were of different depth and size.
On the basis of the depth and length of the wounds I am telling
that they could have been caused by two different weapons. If
only a small portion of a long edged weapon had hit the body,
then the size of the wound will be smaller."
PW-4, Siyarani, as already noticed, suffered two injuries â\200\223 one on the
hand by blow of Pabbal dealt by Vrindavan and the other on the left hand
dealt by a farsa blow by appellant Brijrani. PW-18 â\200\223 Dr. K.P. Tripathi
examined PW.4 on 17.5.1985 and found the following injuries on her body:
1. "Incised wound : 4" x Â½" deep upto the bones, on the
front side of the head.
2. Incised wound: 3" x 2" x Â½" on the frontal part of left
hand".
The medical evidence corroborates the ocular testimony of PW.4 in
material particulars.
In the premises aforesaid, we have no reason to take a view different
from the view taken by the two courts concurrently. This appeal, accordingly,
stands dismissed.
The appellant is on bail. She shall be taken in custody
forthwith. Her bail bonds stand cancelled.
